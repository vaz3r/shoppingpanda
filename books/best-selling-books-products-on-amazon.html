Growing up, the voices of the FOX reporters would be in the background. He would switch to CNN from time to time so I would get a good listen on them. What both channels had in common was that these so-called adults would complain like little kids most of the time. But one stood out that had a very calm attitude, which was Charles Krauthammer. Asking myself how he keeps his composure at such a calm state with all these people I didn't know that he was paralyzed which was a tragic story. Even though I ignored the stuff my dad was watching, if I heard Mr. Krauthammer talk, then I would keep an open ear pretending I wasn't interested.  What got me interested in buying this book was because Mr. Krauthammer had many other interests outside of politics like art, math, music, chess science and sports. The first hour reading the book, I fell in love with it immediately and couldn't put it down. He used a lot of different non-political fields to explain politics and it made so much sense. Some moments even caused me to burst out in laughter. It's not in any way deep reading. The prose is addictive and the chapters are about a two and a half pages so it makes you feel like, okay, one more article and I get some lunch or sleep. But you might end up like me and read for two hours straight without realizing it.  Anyone trying to dip their feet into politics for the first time should add this to your basic reading list. From what everyone else is saying, I'm not the only one who feels this way." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Anthony never goes far beyond the truth of spending his time in a kitchen. Explaining each and every detail about his experiences from culinary school all the way to executive chef running his own restaurant. There's definitely some evil out there, but also many rewards. He tells it how it is. There's plenty of spoilers in this book including talk about what kinds of knives to use, kitchen equipment and about how to improve upon your own skills as a chef, restaurant employee or even an owner. However, this is really a story--not business for dummies. He's done a great job here." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Plant Paradox: The Hidden Dangers in Healthy Foods That Cause Disease and Weight Gain" review="The idea behind the book is intriguing and I'm going to try it for a few months.However, the book is PAINFUL to read. There are a few concepts that he covers over and over and over again using different levels of details and horrible examples. He compares your gut bacteria to a neighborhood, to animals, and other things that are too ridiculous to consider. It's like he explains everything at the lowest possible level but also at a highly scientific level. 5 different ways and all over the book. He is repeatedly being redundant again.The book needs to be about 3 chapters long, get to the point, and be done with it. Here it is:1. Lectins are bad. There are 7 deadly disruptors: antibiotics, NSAIDS, stomach acid blockers, artificial sweeteners, hormone disruptors, herbacides, and blue light. For details, see Dr. Gundry's website for deadly-disruptors-plant-paradox.2. Avoid these things in your food by avoiding foods that naturally have lectin-producing parts. Find out what your food ate. Veggies need to be non-GMO, organic, chemical-free. Basically, go to the farmer's market. Organic isn't good enough. Fish need to be wild-caught and fresh. Chicken needs to be pastured, organic, and non GMO. Organic meat can still be fed corn and grains, which are bad for you. Do the best you can with your location and budget. Avoid beef and pork for a while, then eventually get well-sourced clean-eating animals. Avoid sugar, including fruit. Sugar makes you fat. For a list of yes and no foods, see Dr. Gundry's website for plant-paradox-shopping-list.3. Avoid these things in household items. Don't touch thermal receipts. Don't take the medicine listed above. Don't use plastic wrap or Ziploc bags. You already knew not to use Teflon, BPA plastics, or hand sanitizers with triclosan. No sunscreens or deodorant with parabens or aluminum. (He doesn't mention that it's smelly and gorss for about 3 weeks when you switch from aluminum/paraben based deodorants.) Avoid makeup with the same.There are some meal plans in the book that basically result in eating lettuce (the taste of sadness) 5 times a day for the first 3 days. (Uh - NO!) Then there are recipes to help you cheat the plan by making fake muffins and pancakes.Seriously, just eat eggs and sweet potatoes for breakfast. Eat chicken and veggies for lunch. Eat some nuts or avocado for a snack. Eat some fish and veggies for dinner. Feel better." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Personally, it has helped me focus on the one person who is the LAST to get my attention and effort. Myself.In each chapter, Rachel starts with a lie you tell yourself, provides examples from her own life illustrating it, then lists the tools she used (or wished she had) that help overcome the lie. She writes as if she's your bestie giving advice and sometimes tough love over a VLC (vodka la croix). She's honest, vulnerable and nerdy which I found made her stories endearing. The first chapter begins, I peed my pants last week. She's not afraid to share embarrassing stories and an incredibly painful history to connect with readers. It all seems to stem from her passion for people to grow and an attempt to create a culture where women from all walks of life hold each other up rather than tear each other down. That's a world I want to live in.Though Rachel is a Christian and I'm an atheist, I did not find her mentions of her faith to be overly preachy. Her advice does not depend on one particular belief system. For example, 5 to Thrive is practical advice for any person. 5 to Thrive has changed my life. The idea is that you do these 5 things every day for 30 days: 1. Drink half your body weight in ounces of water. 2. Exercise for 30 minutes. 3. Wake up an hour early using the hour for yourself. 4. Give up 1 food or category of food. 5. List 10 things you're grateful for from that day. Waking an hour early was the most challenging, but I found it was the most beneficial. Now each day I start feeling productive and ready for anything. My attitude has changed, my health has improved, and I'm more intentional with my family as a result of dwelling on my many blessings. After applying this strategy for more than 30 days, it's no longer a strategy but a lifestyle.Ultimately, reading this book will not change your life. No person, no book, no thing can fix what is broken for you. Rachel writes, Only you have the power to change your life. This book can give you the tools that you need to reach your goals and make lasting change to live your best life, but it's up to you to make it happen. She writes, Please stop telling yourself you deserve this life. Please stop justifying a continued crappy existence simply because that's the way it's always been. Just as you've chosen to stay in this place for so long, you can choose too to get yourself out of it. It's what I needed to hear at this time in my life and I recommend this book to others who may need additional encouragement or direction." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Growing up, the voices of the FOX reporters would be in the background. He would switch to CNN from time to time so I would get a good listen on them. What both channels had in common was that these so-called adults would complain like little kids most of the time. But one stood out that had a very calm attitude, which was Charles Krauthammer. Asking myself how he keeps his composure at such a calm state with all these people I didn't know that he was paralyzed which was a tragic story. Even though I ignored the stuff my dad was watching, if I heard Mr. Krauthammer talk, then I would keep an open ear pretending I wasn't interested.  What got me interested in buying this book was because Mr. Krauthammer had many other interests outside of politics like art, math, music, chess science and sports. The first hour reading the book, I fell in love with it immediately and couldn't put it down. He used a lot of different non-political fields to explain politics and it made so much sense. Some moments even caused me to burst out in laughter. It's not in any way deep reading. The prose is addictive and the chapters are about a two and a half pages so it makes you feel like, okay, one more article and I get some lunch or sleep. But you might end up like me and read for two hours straight without realizing it.  Anyone trying to dip their feet into politics for the first time should add this to your basic reading list. From what everyone else is saying, I'm not the only one who feels this way." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It is brilliantly and beautifully written with drama, suspense, and insight that only a few people in this world can have. I almost wish that Bill Clinton's name was not on the cover of the book because it seems that people are polarizing and politicizing the whole thing. Regardless of who wrote the book, if you love a great novel of suspense with historical context, if you are a political junkie who enjoys novels, if you like to binge on exciting drama and suspense, then you would probably enjoy reading this book. It is a thick book, over 500 pages and 100+ chapters that will keep you reading page after page, chapter after chapter. It feels solid in your hand and your lap.  It will keep you entertained for hours, if not days." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Before this book, I really didn't fully understand what a Ketogenic Diet was.  Chapter 1 defines it for me in 4 words, Low-Carb, High-Fat.  This diet promotes fresh whole foods and healthy fats & oils, and cuts out processed, chemically treated foods.  It also tells you that when you start a Keto Diet, you'll most likely experience the Keto-Flu!Chapter 2 - Go Keto in 5 steps.  1-clean out your pantry.  Egads!  No dates or peas, 2 of my favorites!  2-Go shopping and stock up on the basics- water, coffee, tea, spices, herbs, non-sugar sweeteners, lemon & lime juice, mayo, mustard, pesto, sriracha, broths, pickled foods, nuts & seeds, meats, eggs, wild caught fish, nonstarchy veggies, berries, avocados, full fat dairy, avocado oil, olive oil, butter, lard, bacon fat. 3-set up your kitchen with a food scale, food processor, spiralizer, hand mixer, and cast iron pan.  4- plan your meals, and 5 -exercise!Part 2, the 14 day meal plan, not only gives you the meal outline for the week for breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, and dinner, but it gives you the nutritional breakdown of calories, fat, protein, carbs, fiber & net carbs, it then gives you what page to find the recipe on, THEN it gives you a weekly shopping list!

As a former chef, I can scan recipes and know immediately if they are a hit or miss, and I've yet to see a recipe in this book that I won't be excited to create.  Most ingredients will be found right in your neighborhood grocery store, which is another nod to Dr. Gundry's attention to detail.  The recipes vary greatly and will appeal to many different tastes.  Anyone that feels any degree of restriction in following the Plant Paradox protocol will be thrilled to dive into this book and start cooking.  I'm inspired to just cook my way through from beginning to end." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Hate U Give" review="I had originally said I was not going to read this book, I didn't know how well I would like it, and I don't tend to get involved with things that can make life at work harder for me. I literally work with the police, I am a dispatcher, so it is a huge part of my life. I knew going in it was revolved around the BLM movement, and police brutality and I made the decision to read it anyways. I had heard so many good things about it and I just needed to see for myself. First I want to say, it does not at any point in this book bash police officers. It talks about some of the problems in the world and how things happen but it never attacks or sets out to make them out to monsters. I really liked that because most aren't, they just aren't, they are humans. Now, Starr is the main character who is involved in a horrible tragedy that leaves her friend from child hood Khalil dead by an officer involved shooting. It was horrible and it was really sad. I hated reading it, I cried my eyes out, Thomas did such an amazing job of making a horrible action into beautiful fiction that made you feel like you were right there. I was so broken by this part of the story. Then reading later on into Starr's grief was just hard. I don't know any other way to describe it but there will be tears, so very many tears. That isn't it though, you see her as they have to fight the system basically, and you are with them through all those emotions. Going to the funeral and seeing his family, destroyed, his mother broken, knowing this isn't just something that happens in fiction, you cannot help but be moved. Now there was some real good in this book too, like some parts that I laughed until I cried. The scene when her parents are arguing in the middle of a prayer I have read an thousand times since finishing the book because it is the funnies thing I have ever read. Her parents were amazing by the way, her dad was an ex-con but he loved her, he admitted his mistakes but he was there for her. Their relationship was really touching to read because I have always been really close to my own dad. Then there was her mom, and her Uncle Carlos, who was actually a cop and lived in a really good neighborhood too. This was really refreshing to read because so many books, YA especially make parents out to be monsters that don't care, that aren't there for their kids. I mean it is like a troupe or something for these stories and it isn't actually the norm and gets annoying to read, so this book did an amazing job with the parents and family. All around though this story just floored me, it gave me a perspective I have never considered before, offered insights into a world I am not a part of, and I loved every minute of it. I don't know what it is to watch one friend die by violence of any sort, much less two in the time of my life and I am 26, she is a teenager. It is jarring to see that as someones existence when it is not your own. It taught me to open my eyes... I love it... Honestly I just wanted to pick it right back up and read it again." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It's entertaining to say the least. Pollan takes the heavily loaded topic of psychedelics (LSD and psilocybin) and analyzes it from the compelling perspective of a 63-year-old journalist who's not at all sure he's ever had a single 'spiritually significant' experience. Every few pages, I stopped to wonder how this old guy (sorry, Mr. Pollan) is so much more fluent on the topic than me, a 25-year-old hippie vegan.But that's exactly what makes the book so important. Psychedelics don't need to be locked in a role as mind-expanding recreational drugs for young hippies. Research suggests they can play an important role in combating mental illness, and if properly regulated, provide psychological benefits for the betterment of well people. If there's anyone best suited to help society move past the 1960s and take a fresh, honest look at psychedelics, it's Michael Pollan.Also consider listening to his podcast with Tim Ferriss about this new book." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Magnolia Table: A Collection of Recipes for Gathering" review="My husband bought this book for me for Mother’s Day. I had no idea what to expect and I’m delighted with it. It’s a collection of their family recipes from both sides, so it’s a great blend of mostly southern comfort food, with a few Syrian and Korean dishes with a family friendly, yet sophisticated vibe. Her recipes are easy, flavorful, and call for everyday ingredients. I think she has a slight crush on Gruyere cheese. I’m fine with that because I do, too.My thoughts and pics of the dishes we’ve tried:1-2) Gaines Brothers Burgers – p 81 with Bacon-Tomato Sweet Drip Jam – p 82. These were great burgers! They were huge, so next time, I’m making them 6 oz each instead of nearly 11! The tomato drip jam makes enough to make this dinner twice. I considered scaling it back, but I’m so glad I didn’t because it’s soooo good!3) Layered Arugula Salad with Pear Vinaigrette – p 121. Beautiful and lovely flavor balance. The punch of the blue cheese is perfect against the sweet pears and candied walnuts, and the tart pomegranate arils are a nice contrast.4-5) Stew with Jalapeño Cornbread – p 261. This is delicious. The beef stew has tons of flavor. The cornbread isn’t sweetened at all beyond corn’s natural sweetness. The corn kernels, jalapeños, and pimentos make it really yummy, and not too spicy, and the texture’s great. This dinner’s a total keeper.6-7) Buttermilk Blueberry Puff – p 291. So rich and sweet. This is easy peasy, but a wonderfully decadent croissant bread pudding for brunch. (I think she has it in desserts.) I prepped it the night before and let it come to room temperature while I gave the oven plenty of time to preheat. It added a few minutes to the baking time, but worked really well.8) Potato Gratin Mini Stacks – p 179. As yummy as they are cute.9) Beef Tenderloin with Pickled Jalapeno Sour Cream – p 249. This is delicious. The marinade’s great, and we loved the jalapeno sauce.10) Roasted Asparagus with Red Wine Bernaise Sauce – p 163. This was really good. The sauce should be silky. You wont stop whisking to answer your darling child’s text, so you wont break your emulsion, and yours will be much more aesthetically pleasing. Lol!11) I sliced the leftover tenderloin paper thin and piled it on hoagies toasted with butter and garlic salt with a little thin extra sharp cheddar melted on it, and spooned that jalapeno cream over it. That was a fantastic sandwich!I’ll update this as I play in the book more!Some others I have flagged to try: Jojo’s biscuits – p 18 with Bob’s Classic Gravy – p 21 * Garlic Cheese Grits – p 31 * Eggs Benedict Casserole – p 35 * Syrian Donuts – p 45 * Quick Orange Walnut Sweet Rolls – p 57 * Curry Chicken Salad with Toasted Nuts – p 79 * Country Potato Soup with Crumbled Bacon – p 103 * Sausage and Kale Soup – p 109 * White Cheddar Bisque – p 111 * Autumn Butternut Squash Soup – p 113 * Brussels Sprouts Salad – p 115 * Peach Caprese – p 117 * Deviled Eggs – p 133 * Party Queso – p 135 * Baked Brie – p 150 * Sheet Pan Nachos – p 151 * White Bean Hummus – p 153 * Souffled Broccoli Casserole – p 171 * Creamy Squash Casserole with Green Chiles – p 177 * Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas – p 193 * Chicken Pot Pie – p 197 * Dedication Casserole – p 197 * King Ranch Chicken with Mexican-Style Jicama Salad – p 207 * Mom’s Bulgogi with Cucumber Kimchi Salad – p 240 * Jo’s Fatayar with Lebanese Salad – p 244 * Broiled Honey Thyme Peaches with Ice Cream and Aged Balsamic – p 281 * Chocolate Orange Bread Pudding – p 293" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life" review="As someone who has given far too many f***s about far too many things their entire life, this book was exactly the wake up call I needed. Even as a child in elementary school, I would have a miniature meltdown when I got a bad grade or if a friend was mean to me that day. As an adult, I got better at hiding these emotional upheavals and intense reactions to the world around me, but they never really went away with my maturity like I had hoped. I took to heart every disheartening news article I read and every crappy thing that happened to me at work or in school. I'd let it consume me, because I was never told to live life any other way or that controlling my reactions was even remotely possible; I thought it was just a permanent part of my personality. I always knew that it was more of a vice than a virtue, but I felt like I couldn't fully control it.Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*** employs a witty use of profanity laced with satirical comedy that's bursting with philosophical wisdom. Much of Manson's inspiration originates from nihilists, Buddhists, Albert Camus, and Charles Bukowski, but he brings those philosophies into a more modern and palatable perspective. He reminds us that life is too short to react so passionately about every little thing. We have a limited emotional capacity, and we often squander it on reactions to mean-spirited people or unfortunate events, completely forgetting that, although we can't control the world around us, we can control ourselves. This book has empowered me to exercise control over my reactions.Shortly after reading this book, my husband commented at how zen I've become. I'm no longer angrily venting to him about all of the various ways the world upsets me. I still allow myself to feel and talk about things that bother me (I'm not aiming to achieve nirvana as a Buddhist monk), but petty things no longer have a hold on me. I let the negativity wash over me now without letting it absorb into my soul, and my life has been much more enjoyable as a result.I was so inspired by this book and its philosophy, that I wanted a permanent reminder for myself to further ensure that I use my f***s wisely from now onward. For my birthday, I got this simple, but meaningful tattoo on my right wrist. The ∞ symbol reminds me of the infinite nature of time and outer space, and the 0 on the bottom represents humanity's relevance to time and space as a whole. It can also be translated as don't make something (∞) out of nothing (0) or a reminder that there are infinite opportunities to give a f***, but that I will remain steadfast in giving 0 f***s about things that don't really matter.If you're the type of person who's struggled to keep their temper in line or if you're like me and you find yourself on an emotional roller-coaster because you take every event in the world and within your own life to heart, I strongly encourage you to read this book. If profanity is so much of a problem for you, that you can't tolerate reading the first half of this book (the last half is much less profane) you're probably too narrow-minded to have taken away any of the many philosophical benefits this book offers." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos" review="Jordan Peterson is a beacon of light in this chaotic world, a psychologist whose writing combines science and common sense. One of his talents is his ability to articulate complex ideas to a wide audience. Regardless of whether you have a background in psychology or not, you will understand this book. It covers his twelve rules for life, which are intended not only as a guide for life of the individual, but as a remedy for society’s present ills. Peterson believes that the cure for society starts with curing the individual, the smallest unit of society. Peterson’s well-known advice to clean your room is a reflection of the truth that if you can’t even manage the most basic and mundane responsibilities of life, then you have no business dictating to others how to fix society.One of the main themes of this book is: Personal change is possible. There's no doubt you can be slightly better today than you were yesterday. Because of Pareto's Principle (small changes can have disproportionately large results), this movement towards the good increases massively, and this upward trajectory can take your life out of hell more rapidly than you could believe. Life is tragic and full of suffering and malevolence. But there's something you can start putting right, and we can't imagine what good things are in store for us if we just fix the things that are within our power to do so.The 12 Rules for Life:In Peterson’s own words, it’s 12 rules to stop you from being pathetic, written from the perspective of someone who himself tried to stop being pathetic and is still working on it. Peterson is open about his struggles and shortcomings, unlike many authors who only reveal a carefully curated façade.Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back. People have bad posture, and the meaning behind it can be demonstrated by animal behaviors. Peterson uses the example of the lobster. When a lobster loses a fight, and they fight all the time, it scrunches up a little. Lobsters run on serotonin and when he loses, levels go down, and when he wins, levels go up and he stretches out and is confident. Who cares? We evolutionarily diverged from lobsters 350 million years ago, but it’s still the same circuit. It’s a deep instinct to size others up when looking at them to see where they fit in the social hierarchy. If your serotonin levels fall, you get depressed and crunch forward and you’re inviting more oppression from predator personalities and can get stuck in a loop. Fixing our posture is part of the psycho-physiological loop that can help you get started back up again.Rule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping. People often have self-contempt whether they realize it or not. Imagine someone you love and treat well. You need to treat yourself with the same respect. Take care of yourself, your room, your things, and have respect for yourself as if you’re a person with potential and is important to the people around you. If you make a pattern of bad mistakes, your life gets worse, not just for you, but for the people around you. All your actions echo in ways that cannot be imagined. Think of Stalin’s mother and the mistakes she made in life, and how the ripple effects went on to affect the millions of people around him.Rule 3: Choose your friends carefully. It is appropriate for you to evaluate your social surroundings and eliminate those who are hurting you. You have no ethical obligation to associate with people who are making your life worse. In fact, you are obligated to disassociate with people who are trying to destroy the structure of being, your being, society’s being. It’s not cruel, it’s sending a message that some behaviors are not to be tolerated.Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today. You need to improve, and you may even be in real bad shape, but many unfairly compare themselves to some more seemingly successful person. Up till around age 17, random comparisons to other people can make sense, but afterwards, especially age 30+, our lives become so idiosyncratic that comparisons with others become meaningless and unhelpful. You only see a slice of their life, a public facet, and are blind to the problems they conceal.Rule 5: Don't let children do things that make you dislike them. You aren't as nice as you think, and you will unconsciously take revenge on them. You are massively more powerful than your children, and have the ability and subconscious proclivity for tyranny deeply rooted within you.If you don't think this is true, you don't know yourself well enough. His advice on disciplinary procedure: (1) limit the rules. (2) use minimum necessary force and (3) parents should come in pairs.It's difficult and exhausting to raise children, and it's easy to make mistakes. A bad day at work, fatigue, hunger, stress, etc, can make you unreasonable.Rule 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world. Life is tragic and there's malevolence. There's plenty to complain about, but if you dwell on it, you will become bitter and tread down a path that will take you to twisted places. The diaries of the Columbine killers are a chilling look into minds that dwelled on the unholy trinity of deceit, arrogance, and resentment) . So instead of cursing the tragedy that is life, transform into something meaningful. Start by stop doing something, anything, that you know to be wrong. Everyday you have choices in front of you. Stop doing and saying things that make you weak and ashamed. Do only those things that you would proudly talk about in public.Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient). Meaning is how you protect yourself against the suffering that life entails. This means that despite the fact that we’re all emotionally wounded by life, we’ve found something that makes it all worthwhile. Meaning, Peterson says, is like an instinct, or a form of vision. It lets you know when you’re in the right place, and he says that the right place is midway between chaos and order. If you stay firmly ensconced within order, things you understand, then you can’t grow. If you stay within chaos, then you’re lost.  Expediency is what you do to get yourself out of trouble here and now, but it comes at the cost of sacrificing the future for the present. So instead of doing what gets you off the hook today, aim high. Look around you and see what you can make better. Make it better. As you gain knowledge, consciously remain humble and avoid arrogance that can stealthily creep on you. Peterson also says to be aware of our shortcomings, whatever they may be; our secret resentments, hatred, cowardice, and other failings. Be slow to accuse others because we too conceal malevolent impulses, and certainly before we attempt to fix the world.Rule 8: Tell the truth—or, at least, don't lie. Telling the truth can be hard in the sense that it’s often difficult to know the truth. However, we can know when we’re lying. Telling lies makes you weak. You can feel it, and others can sense it too. Meaning, according to Peterson, is associated with truth, and lying is the antithesis of meaning. Lying disassociates you with meaning, and thus reality itself. You might get away with lying for a short while, but only a short time. In Peterson’s words “It was the great and the small lies of the Nazi and Communist states that produced the deaths of millions of people.”Rule 9: Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't. A good conversation consists of you coming out wiser than you went into it. An example is when you get into an argument with your significant other, you want to win, especially if you get angry. If you’re more verbally fluent than the other person then you can win. One problem is that the other person might see something better than you, but they can’t quite articulate it as well. Always listen because there’s a possibility they’re going to tell you something that will prevent you from running headfirst into a brick wall. This is why Peterson says to listen to your enemies. They will lie about you, but they will also say true things about yourself that your friends won’t. Separate the wheat from the chaff and make your life better.Rule 10: Be Precise in Your Speech: There is some integral connection between communication and reality (or structures of belief as he likes to say). Language takes chaos and makes it into a ‘thing.’ As an example, imagine going through a rough patch in your life where you can’t quite put your finger on what’s wrong. This mysterious thing that’s bothering you—is it real? Yes, if it’s manifesting itself as physical discomfort. Then you talk about it and give it a name, and then this fuzzy, abstract thing turns into a specific thing. Once named, you can now do something about it. The unnameable is far more terrifying than the nameable. As an example, the movie the Blair Witch project didn’t actually name or describe the evil. Nothing happens in the movie, it’s all about the unnameable. If you can’t name something, it means it’s so terrifying to you that you can’t even think about it, and that makes you weaker. This is why Peterson is such a free speech advocate. He wants to bring things out of the realm of the unspeakable. Words have a creative power and you don’t want to create more mark and darkness by imprecise speech.Rule 11: Don’t bother children when they are skateboarding. This is mainly about masculinity. Peterson remembers seeing children doing all kinds of crazy stunts on skateboards and handrails, and believes this is an essential ingredient to develop masculinity, to try to develop competence and face danger. Jordan Peterson considers the act of sliding down a handrail to be brave and perhaps stupid as well, but overall positive. A lot of rebellious behavior in school is often called ‘toxic masculinity,’ but Peterson would say to let them be. An example would be a figure skater that makes a 9.9 on her performance, essentially perfect. Then the next skater that follows her seems to have no hope. But she pushes herself closer to chaos, beyond her competence, and when successful, inspires awe. Judges award her 10’s. She’s gone beyond perfection into the unknown and ennobled herself as well as humanity as well.Rule 12: Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street. This chapter is mainly autobiographical and he writes about tragedy and pain. When tragic things are in front of you and you’re somewhat powerless, you must keep your eyes open for little opportunities that highlight the redemptive elements of life that make it all worthwhile. The title of this chapter comes from his experience of observing a local stray cat, and watching it adapt to the rough circumstances around it. Another thing you must do when life is going to pieces is to shorten your temporal horizon. Instead of thinking in months, you maybe think in hours or minutes instead. You try to just have the best next minute or hour that you can. You shrink the time frame until you can handle it, this is how you adjust to the catastrophe. You try to stay on your feet and think.  Although this chapters deals about harsh things, it’s an overall positive one. Always look for what’s meaningful and soul-sustaining even when you’re where you’d rather not be." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="All We Ever Wanted: A Novel" review="I've read a good many of Emily Giffin's books and she's definitely a talented author, but don't go into this one expecting a lighthearted rom-com. The story here, despite its fairly festive, and slightly deceptive cover and title, is no romantic romp. In her more recent novels, Giffin has trended towards more serious family drama, and with this one she jumps into that deep end for sure.This is the story of the Brownings, one of Nashville's golden couples whose son, Finch, attends a prestigious private school and whose parents, old money Kirk, and the less entrenched Nina, rule the social scene. Tom, on the other hand, is a (mostly) single father, whose daughter, Lyla, attends Windsor Academy on scholarship.The book and marketing are extremely coy about how the two families become inextricably intertwined, though it's revealed very early on and is the entire crux of the book, but if you don't want to know, skip to after the next ellipses ...[slight spoiler warning]While his parents attend yet another benefit, Princeton-bound Finch Snapchats a picture of a passed out, partially disrobed Lyla captioned with a racist joke, which soon the whole school has seen and changes both their lives.[/end small spoiler]... How both sets of parents, and children, handle the fallout, is the entire story. The focus is very much on the parents here, namely Tom and Nina, both of whom come at the issue with their kids in different ways due to their own, troubled pasts, which are fairly quickly revealed. Lyla gets a bit more attention in the story, but Finch and Kirk have a fairly skimpy place in this tale.This is fast-paced and, while not always 100% credible—I think the author likes Nina way more than I, the reader, did—it does set up some semi-interesting moral dilemmas, though none are handled especially subtly.It's also a terrifying read as a parent, as you see the many, many ways kids can make incredibly bad, life-changing decisions in mere seconds, which we are completely unable to protect them from. Not that Giffin leans in too much to that aspect, making pretty clear moral judgements that will allow most readers to fall comfortably into the, this could never happen to me, camp. But, I could see a similar, more nuanced scenario that would ultimately make for a more interesting story, where the moral black and white is much more shades of gray and yeah-it-COULD-happen-to-you.I wavered between three and four stars here, and settled on the latter most because this one was fast-paced and Giffin is an adapt author who knows how to tease out a page turner. ALL WE EVER WANTED kept me engaged until the end, even through its more predictable plot points and ultimately unsatisfying ending, and I finished it in just two settings. Not terribly deep, it's still a decent read." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts" review="It is definitely a good book for couples and it has improved my relationship with my wife.  If nothing else it shows you what things your partner is really looking for out of their spouse.  I quickly found that my love language was Acts of Service.  Though it might not be sexy or macho to say that, it means more to me to have the dishes and laundry done when I come home after work or have minor home improvements taken care of before I get home.  My wife and I have 2 small children and our house is hard to stay clean because every room feels like a mess.  We do clean it all the time but it feels like a losing battle.  My wife's love language is Words of Affirmation.  As you can tell from all these Amazon reviews I am much more of a writer than I am a talker.  My wife is always looking for me to say how much I love and appreciate her because I don't say it often enough.A big part of improving your relationship with your spouse or boyfriend/girlfriend is to sticking with a date night to make sure you have quality time together.  Especially if you have children or a high stress occupation.  My wife and I have been together for 10 years and got stuck in the rut of an endless routine of doing everything we could for our kids, followed by daily chores and left little time for ourselves.  Committing to 1 date night a week has really helped our relationship and improved our communication.I recommend the book for sure and found it inspiring and worth reading.  All couples can benefit from reading this book.  The only downside is I wish it could have been a little longer.  The stories from the author are interesting and I would have liked to have heard a bunch of his other examples of couples that he has dealt with.  It was a short book and my wife and I finished it in 4 or 5 days and that was reading it slowly.  The price is easily affordable.  I found it best to photo copy the test quiz at the end instead of writing in the book so we can give the book to any family or friends who are struggling with their relationship." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

If you've read other self help books then you probably won't find much that's new here. In fact, it's really the in-your-face tone and humor in her writing that makes this book worthwhile. As for her ideas, I personally found a lot to take issue with. First, she has a very polarized view of spiritual growth that divides our lives in to those that suck and those that are awesome. Maybe that works for young millennials just starting out in life, and if that's the audience she’s g oing for, then great, but most of us are somewhere on a continuum and her assertions that life is either this way or that way are simplistic to say the least. Sincero also uses a lot of highly critical, edgy language to describe people who are struggling or stuck - therefore not as awesome as she is - using words like lame-o  suck wuss  ...well, you get the idea. This may be mildly amusing the first time around, but it gets old fast and it's not exactly kind to those who may really be struggling. I have to confess that I question a writer who continually references her own life choices and personal career success as a model that the rest of us should follow. There is an exhibitionistic, narcissistic, look at me, look at how successful I am dimension running through this book that is self-indulgent while lacking insight about what success could mean or look like for another person.  Read this book for a quick shot of motivation if that's what you need, it's good for that, but look elsewhere for help in developing your own ideas and values about  success and purpose. This is the Jen Sincero version and it may not apply to you." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

At this point I barely remember where it left off. I spent literally 15 minutes doing research to figure out if the last book I read was book 9 or 10. Thankfully it was 10. It is 1:03 A.M. and i am a quarter way done with the book. It was literally released an hour and three minutes ago and so far it is great. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes anything. Thats basically it. First review! Wooh!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fahrenheit 451" review="In a future society, books are forbidden and firemen responsible for burning the remaining titles. That's the job of one Guy Montag, but he begins to question his role as he gets in contact with a teenager who reads secretly. And he becomes himself a criminal reader of smuggled books.The most surprising thing about Fahrenheit 451 is that it's premise could, in the hands of a lesser writer, easily turn a condescending little lesson about the importance of reading books. But like any work of art that would be missed if it was burned, Fahrenheit 451 doesn't want to give you answers. The book wants you to ask questions.The main point for me is not that books are burned. That is only the most dramatic side of something bigger: that society allows them to be burned, and that no one is interested in reading in the first place. The only sources of distraction for the denizens of Fahrenheit 451 are sports or soap operas in televisions the size of entire walls. The speed of television does not allow you to stop and think, just swallow that entertainment loaf. From this insipid entertainment are born people who literally talk to the walls and a society unable to question.Montag's wife, Mildred is one example. She can't talk about anything other than the soaps or what threatens her financial security. She is a cattle-person, described as having an invisible cataract behind her pupils, afraid of anything different, incapable of thinking or feeling without directions from the TV or authorities. Montag discovers how they can't connect to one another because in the end they don't know their own history. And without that knowledge you can't even know who you are, or what you want.Today is 2015, and the society described in Fahrenheit 451 seems even more palpable than when the book was written in 1953. The internet shortens our attention span towards shorter and simpler texts and videos. More than ever we more intelligent - we have access to an ocean of information literally at our finger tips - but we are not wise. We don't know what to do with our information.And we have no memory. The social media timelines dictate the discussion of the day, what funny video is trending, what news we should be disgusted with, what meme will be the big joke for a day or two before it is once again forgotten. Fahrenheit 451 even reminds us of the mass society judgments that lead to self-censorship.I believe reading is fundamentally important for wisdom, more than any other art form. Reading is solitary work. It demands silence, and to let your ideas absorb the author's, contest them, accept or adapt. Fahrenheit 451 says that you can't make others think, but I believe it comes with a good recipe for wisdom: Number one, like I said, is quality of information. Number two: time to digest. And number three: the right  to conduct your actions based on what we learn from the two previous items." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I can't quite pinpoint when his verbosity stopped, but it's a welcome change.This is more in the Mr. Mercedes universe than the old Derry/Castle Rock/Things that go bump in the night universe of old.  It starts out being a perplexing murder mystery, and it's not until later in the story that supernatural elements start creeping in. By that time, though, you're so involved in the story that the supernatural elements seem plausible...and then they start making sense.  As the book quotes, Arthur Conan Doyle (via Sherlock Holmes) said Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.  King manages to eliminate the impossible, slowly yet surely.I've started measuring how good I think a mystery/horror book is by how tense I get when I read it.  I was extremely tense reading this one, wondering just what the solution was going to be.I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoyed the Mr. Mercedes trilogy, or 11/22/63." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I found it incredibly dull and tedious and finally gave up halfway through.A few weeks ago I took my mother to a dental appointment and opened my Kindle to see what I had available while I waited.  I decided to give this book another try and started from the beginning, as I couldn't remember anything from what I read previously.  I'm not sure what was different this time around, but I was completely engrossed and my 2 hour wait flew by!  I continued to read whenever I found a chance and finished it within a few days.  I now find myself constantly thinking of the story and relating it to my own life, as well as my friends and family.It's a short and very simple story, but definitely worth reading!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="First 100 Words" review="First 100 Words by Roger Priddy was bought as a gift for my sons’s first birthday and it is the perfect book for a one year old. It is quite a basic book and the sort of board book most children will have at some stage in their life. It definitely deserves mention, as my son chooses it from his library nearly every day.Previous reviews have indicated some confusion over the book size. This version of the book is pretty small (it's 5 x 6 inches; an over-sized ABC/colors version can be found here), and it can withstand rough little hands as it is a board book.Each brightly colored page shows various photographs alongside the corresponding word. I like that it uses photographs instead of illustrations (animals wearing clothes, etc.). The pages are split into themes of things your LO will probably recognize from everyday life, such as clothes, food, things that go and so on.My son has had this book for a couple of months now and it’s been a huge hit with him. He will sit on the floor and look through it himself. Together, we look at the pages and I point to each picture and say the word. I’ve started him with some Tiny Tutor videos to supplement our lessons while I do chores around the house. We do this most days and the repetition seems to be paying off, as he seems to recognize a new thing in the book every day.Although rather basic on the face of it, I am really delighted with this book and wish we’d had it sooner. It is selling for under $5 on Amazon which I think is a real bargain. I’ve noticed there are some similar titles, such as First 100 Animals and First 100 Numbers Colors Shapes. I will be looking to purchase these in the future too. It seems the simple things really are the best sometimes.Highly recommended!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Sometime later I was able to hear Bob speak at a student leadership conference and I was just in awe of him.Why do I find Bob Goff so fascinating? Because he lives life with such passion and zeal. His love seems so authentic. He is not just putting words on the page or speaking goodwill to the masses. He is capturing life at its fullest and throwing it back to us.I am very cynical person. I typically view Christian authors as opportunistic over authentic, but with Bob, I see genuine love for all.Everybody, Always is a perfect follow up to Love Does. The book is full of amazing stories and beautiful calls for action. This book is a great challenge for a guy like me, who can become numb and disillusioned with the world.I highly recommend this work to everyone. And, of course, here are some amazing quotes:“Love isn’t something we fall into; love is someone we become.”“Loving people means caring without an agenda.”“What a shame it would be if we were waiting for God to say something while He’s been waiting on us to do something.”“Most of us don’t need more instructions; we simply need someone who believes in us.”“We don’t need to be the hero in everyone’s story. Jesus already landed that part.”“Grace never seems fair until you need some.”" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

She is blunt. Very blunt. She lacks social skills and tends to spout off facts to people just having conversations. She likes her routine. Every Friday, stop and buy pizza and vodka. And every Wednesday, she talks to her mother. Those are never very good for Eleanor. Her mother is mean and angry and leaves her feeling less than.  Something happened to Eleanor when she was a child. Something that left her with a scar on her face and moving from foster home to foster home. Does she remember it all or is it her coping mechanism? Things start to change in her life when her company’s IT guy, Raymond, and Eleanor help an old man who has passed out in the street. Family is the one thing that she has been missing.There is so much to Eleanor. In the beginning, I thought that I didn’t care too much for her but as time went on and she opened up, well, I fell in love with her. I would venture to say that she is on the autism spectrum. What a sad story she had lived and what a wonderful world opening up for her. Beautifully written and just a lovely story, you will fall in love with Eleanor too." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Very Hungry Caterpillar" review="Even though we built quite a collection of children's books during the seven years I spent babysitting our three grandsons, it's always a delight to discover another to add.  This one brought back memories of carefree summer days as a child, how exciting it was to find a caterpillar outside, to feel that little tickley sensation as it would move up my arm, and being amazed when my mother told me it would one day become a butterfly!  I'm so pleased with this little board book that uses the life stages of a butterfly - from egg to caterpillar to cocoon to butterfly - to teach counting, colors, days of the week, foods (not to mention a recipe for a stomach ache!) - very sturdily constructed, brightly illustrated, and at 7 x 5 and a hair less than an inch thick, it'll fit perfectly into the chubby little hands of our two year old little guy on his birthday!The different sized pages in the middle of the book (after the caterpillar pops out of his egg on Sunday morning) showing different foods with holes punched in the centers to indicate where he's nibbled through them are darling - each page is thick enough that I think I'm going to cut a caterpillar-sized piece of green pipecleaner to give him so he can watch his very own caterpillar making its way through the one red apple he eats on Monday, two green pears on Tuesday, three purple plums on Wednesday, four red strawberries on Thursday, five bright orange oranges on Friday, and then the variety of multi-colored foods (probably not a caterpillar's scientifically accurate diet, but fun!) he eats on Saturday that leads to his stomache ache - chocolate cake, ice cream cone, pickle, Swiss cheese, salami, lollipop, cherry pie, sausage, cupcake and watermelon - goodness gracious!On Sunday, he limits himself to one green leaf, builds his small house, called a cocoon, around himself, stays in there for over two weeks before he emerges as a multi-colored butterfly, whose wingspan takes up the final two pages!  Though we probably won't expect our grandson to comprehend the scientific term of metamorphosis, he'll certainly grasp that the caterpillar's transformation is magical - a pretty good description of the book itself!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I would've maybe given it two stars if I checked it out at the local library for free, but I'm annoyed I invested my hard earned American dollars into this book.Either Rupi Kaur is running the biggest poetry scam of all time or this was the most over hyped book in existence. This was honestly one of those books that halfway through I thought, really? I could have written this. The majority of the poems are like 10 words or less. This book kind of seems like one big waste of environmental resources. Entire pages with hardly anything written on them.In my experience,Putting spacesat random pointsinyour sentencedoesn'tmake it poetryI love slam poetry and spoken word poetry and was hoping to get the same vibe from this, but sadly, no. I prefer poems will a little more meat to them. I will say, there are a HANDFUL of good poems in here. Like maybe 5-7. But most of them are just a random sentence or two with some squiggly drawing next to it that we're supposed to think is amazing artwork.I seriously don't understand if everyone is just reading into the completely non-thought provoking poems in this book and making up their own deep meaning or if I'm just totally missing the boat on this one.I think Rupi is duping us. If you told me my 9-year-old nephew and 6-month-old niece collabed on this book, with him covering the poetry while she handled the artwork, I would fully believe you. And if you told me they completed it in one day, I would also believe you. And if you told me they were both on Ambien while they did it, I would STILL believe you.If you're looking for metaphors, deep poems, clever writing, etc then pass.If you're a 10th grader who just got dumped by Jimmy from home room and you wanna post a snapchat of one of these heart wrenching break up poems to express how angsty you are, you'll love it.Don't believe the hype. Try to check it out at a library or borrow it from a friend to know if you like it or not before you waste your money on it. Actually hmu if you want my copy because I sure don't." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Perfect Couple" review="Upon reading the book blurb for this one, I knew I just had to pre-order it – a beautiful island wedding where the guests are all staying at the same location, and the maid of honour is found dead – sold! And did it live up to my expectations – yes, yes, yes! I knew going in that it was going to be tamer than my usual crime read, leaning more towards contemporary drama, which it was, but I have to say it was a nice change of pace for me, and I really enjoyed it. The mystery plot, which I worried might be too obvious, wasn’t, and even when I thought I had worked it out, turns out I was wrong.There’s a lot of glamour and glitz, talk of décor, scenery, parties, outings, heaps of descriptions of food and drink (which all sounded delicious by the way) but again that was a given before I even opened the book, and was told in such an interesting, insightful way, that I even relished those parts. Nantucket Island sure does sound like a gorgeous place, and the author definitely did it justice.The story opens with the Chief of Police receiving a phone call that the maid of honour has been found floating in the ocean, on the morning of the wedding day, and covers the subsequent investigation that follows. There are also multiple flashbacks to the day before the wedding, as well as the two years leading up to the event. At times the story is pretty heartbreaking and tragic, so keep those tissues handy, but there’s also some amusing and touching moments that have you smiling.After perusing Elin Hilderbrand’s other books, it looks like this is the authors first mystery novel, and I’m keeping my fingers crossed she writes more in this vein, as she did an amazing job. Even though it’s winter here, and I read under the covers with the electric blanket, this would make an excellent summer beach read, as it’s easy to read, and follow." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Crazy Rich Asians (Crazy Rich Asians Trilogy)" review="SynopsisRachel and Nick have been dating for a while and this summer he wants to take her to his home in Singapore for a friend’s wedding and to meet his family. While they think nothing of spending the summer traveling together, his family, who are “crazy rich” (seriously ridiculously rich) are worried that Nick is going to propose to someone who they have not vetted and is not from a “good” family.Review I started this book thinking it would be about a ton of stereotypes blah blah blah. And that it would be a fluff read – it would take me just a few days to get through a beach read. Alas, I was wrong, but in a good way. I was totally entertained and wanted to read more for multiple reasons. One, Kwan describes some of the houses/treasures of the homes so well that I could imagine just how they looked and it was amazing to be able to see this almost panoramic view of these people’s homes. Two, the characters were well written and entertaining. The only thing I had trouble with was keeping track of who all was who (and thus the family tree in the beginning of the book that I referred back to often once I had “met” so many people). I’m currently waiting for the next book (China Rich Girlfriend) to be available from my library. I totally wanted to roll right into book 2 but I’ll have to wait a bit." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Cravings: Recipes for All the Food You Want to Eat" review="Yes. That Chrissy Teigen.One phrase review of this cookbook: Shockingly FantasticLike, shocked shocked. Stunned. Surprised. Unexpected feelings.Ok, composing self to write actual sentences.I fully expected to hate-read this cookbook. Sure, I enjoy a lot of Chrissy Teigen's tweets. She's that rare famous person who makes themselves extremely publicly accessible, but in an actual authentic way. Her online presence doesn't appear to be artfully constructed by a PR firm. She replies to trolls. She talks about buying giant bear stuffed animals from shopping TV. She talks about her husband in a normal, loving, supportive way. She's a reminder that yes, celebrity is another plane of existence, but, it's still a career, and she's still a human being.I knew that she enjoyed cooking. Or, well, attempted a lot of cooking. Her twitter feed contains a lot of posts about failed attempts in the kitchen. It led me to believe Teigen tried to make a lot of food, but that it probably turned out kinda terribly most of the time. So, I selected this cookbook to review just to see what a mess it would be. This celebrity trying to be all cookbook-ey. I expected one of those books with a If you're a super rich person like me, you can have your housekeeper make you gluten-free llama milk infused baby kangaroo burgers too tone. I promised I would give a recipe or two a try, but that I was probably going to pass this book along to someone else for their amusement.Anyway.I. Was. Wrong.This cookbook is awesome.The recipes? They're GREAT. Accessible. Unique, but familiar. Delicious. Unpretentious. Tasty. Good. Yummy. Things I will make again. Dare I say, some new favorites even?Wow. It's just so good. Five star rating worthy. A book deserving of early admission to Food52's Piglet 2017 tournament (even though it does not have the pedigree of the usual entrants).Enough about my surprise about this book. Let's talk about the book itself and why I love it, why I think you might like it.Most importantly: The recipesAs I do with most cookbooks where I start to see a recipe or two, or three, early in the book that I want to make. I started a list. All the recipes I want to try. Maybe not today, but someday. So, I started that list in the breakfast section. That Dutch Baby Pancake looks tasty. Crab Cakes Benedict - wow, I think I could make this. Bacon Hash Browns? Sign me up. I kept going. Soup. Salads. Noodles. Thai. Party. Vegetables. Supper (this one was hard - my parents call it supper - I don't - it'd dinner - but... I let it go). My list had 53 recipes on it. 53. The book only has 95-ish or so recipes, and I want to make over half of them. That's an incredible accomplishment.So, how does this recipes perform in practice? Will our three-and-a-half year old eat them? Are the ingredient lists accurate? Do the steps make sense? Does this feel like a well-tested recipe?Dutch Baby Pancake: Super easy to make. Beautifully random squiggly rise in the oven. Delicious. Six thumbs up. Kid/family-approved.Cobb Salad with Honey Mustard Ranch Dressing: An actual text I sent to my wife: &^%$, this is a good salad. The seasoning on the chicken was fantastic. Just spicy enough to get a bunch of flavor out without passing toddler-acceptable levels. The charred corn was super tasty. The dressing. THAT dressing! The hard boiled eggs. That our toddler ate. That she had never eaten before. The combination. This was one of the best salads I have ever eaten, much less prepared (there are a lot of steps with this one, and there's a whole bunch of chopping, but it's an extremely well-written recipe). Family Favorite List addition.Sesame Chicken Noodles: This is a really well-constructed recipe (you use the same water you boil the chicken in to cook the pasta). It's also really really really good. The sesame-based sauce for the noodles is lick your fingers tasty. The recipe says it serves 4 as a light dinner. Our 2.25 diners licked the pot clean.Italian Sausage Meatloaf: This is a really good recipe - adding Italian Sausage to meatloaf is brilliant - but I screwed it up a little. I tried to make it on a solo parent weeknight, so I rushed a little and didn't mix it up as fully as I should have which led to some mushy breadcrumb only sections. It also needed more time in the oven than the recipe's about 1 hour step. That seems to be common with my latest meatloaf cookery though, so it's not a fault of Chrissy's. My minor related suggestion here though would be to add a cook to XXX degrees step. Overall, this turned out great tasting and I would make it again. On a weekend. When I can give it the proper attention.Skillet-charred Fish Tacos: Five stars. These were just phenomenal. The spice rub for the tilapia was great. The toddler loved the fish. Kelley loved the tacos. I loved the tacos. I ate fish taco leftovers the next day. We'll make this again. Probably soon.Literally Stovetop Pork Chops: We don't usually bread our pork chops. I've certainly never thought, Hey, maybe let's get some Stovetop Stuffing mix and bread our pork chops with that. But, that's what this recipe calls for. And, well, I mean, broken record here, but, it's delicious. It's so good that when I asked our daughter a week later what she wanted for dinner, she said, Hmmm.... Pork Chops!Pad Grapow Chicken (Basil Chicken): This recipe is from the tiny Thai Mom section of the cookbook and it makes me kinda hope for a future Thai Mom specific book. I'm a big fan of Thai food. Kelley is a big fan of Thai food. Our daughter doesn't know a lot about specific International cuisines yet. This recipe was soooooo good. I want to make it again with basil fresh from the garden, because it was delicious with store bought stuff, but I think it would be heavenly with some leaves pulled fresh from the stalk.Buttery Glazed Green Beans: On to a vegetable. A side dish. A simple combination of sugar and water and green beans and butter. Easy recipe, great, slightly crispy green beans.Warm Corn Salad: This is actually a component of the Seared Scallops recipe that I wanted to make, but couldn't find the right scallops for, so we pivoted and had Sole instead. But, I still make the corn salad. And I'm glad I did. In fact, even my not-really-that-big-of-a-fan-of-corn spouse said, This salad is really good, I like how this corn is made. So, yeah, approved.A couple of other review points.The organization of the book is nice. I like having the breakfast vs salad vs noodles vs dinner type sections. I do think she got a little too cutesy with the @*#$& on Toast and Stuff that Seems Complicated But Isn't sections. I get it, I just don't think it was needed.The recipe introductions are right in line with the tone of Chrissy Teigen. A little snarky, a little heartfelt, a lot personal. I like hearing about the background of the recipes. The stuff that reminds her of her mom, or her dad, or that thing that John Legend made that everyone loves. I also like the humor. But. In small doses. If you love love love all of of Chrissy Teigen's tweets, then by all means, sit down and read this cookbook cover-to-cover. You'll love it. On the other hand, if you just like her sense of humor, I might recommend reading the book in small portions. I find that for me, a small dose of Teigen goes a long way. In no way does this detract from the greatness of the food you will make based on this book, but just be forewarned.Overall, I really really like this cookbook. At first I thought it was just because it exceeded my expectations so greatly, but after further analysis, I think it's because it contains really delicious recipes, the recipes themselves are very well-written, and it's obvious that the recipes have been well-tested. I could cook exclusively from this book for a month and we'd be happy family.You should definitely buy this book if you're a huge fan of Chrissy Teigen. But, surprisingly, you should also buy this book if you simply love good food.I received this book from Blogging for Books for this review." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (A Toltec Wisdom Book)" review="I should start off by stating my background. I am an undergrad student of philosophy and linguistics, a branch of the humanities. I also deeply love this series of books because of its obviousness and simplicity. It has personally helped me triumph over many, many challenges. This is why I decided to write a review here.There is a huge tradition of skepticism in linguistics, especially about how language is used in various cultures to create belief systems. A belief system is basically a set of instructions inside your brain based on language. These instructions help you navigate the stressful world around you so you can survive. We are psychologically wired to think our belief systems are accurate and experience deep stress if we find them to be inaccurate.The trouble is, our belief systems are ALWAYS inaccurate. Yes, I used the word always for a reason.Without going deeply into the study of philosophy and linguistics, I will give you an overview here:Philosophy - When you study philosophy, you study belief systems about how the world works and explore important questions like is there a God? or What is consciousness. You may not be surprised to find out that philosophy majors have not come up with answers to these questions because there is always a case where we are going to be wrong or have a counter argument. Much of the study of philosophy is the collection of vocabulary words to describe beliefs. They even have a mathematical component called propositional logic, where one takes sentences and reduces them to symbols and creates proofs but even prop-logic is under fire from academics for its complete inability to predict anything. In other words, it isn't the answer either.Linguistics - When you study words and language, you realize that all our beliefs are based on language and this language can never touch reality in that language is just an arbitrary description of reality, posing as real. I believe Miguel Ruiz must have taken a linguistics course as well--as his first agreement attests to the power of language. The four agreements pulls heavily from Saussure and Derrida. Both Saussure and Derrida (and many, many others) did work on how we form ideas in our heads based on language. The gist is this: we have something called a symbol in our brain which is composed of two parts: the word and the visual representation of the object (look up semiotics for further detail). These symbols are in our mind and work together to form meaning, then belief. The unfortunate thing is that they are entirely made up. It isn't real. Our ideas of it aren't real.If you really want a deeper understanding on how linguistics has saturated our belief systems I recommend reading some of their academic essays or get Rivkin and Ryan's literary theory books. They are excellent and will take you further down the rabbit hole. Most of the essays are dense but worth the effort!To simplify: scientists and academics in the millions have tried and tried and tried to find the true belief for thousands, maybe tens of thousands of years and we have not yet arrived at any truth. Because of domestication, we think other people have it, but they don't! Truth is defined as that which has the most predictive power. So far, mathematics, geometry, and physics has the most predictive power. Our belief systems simply do not.So any beliefs about yourself can be true and they can also be false. We can't know. So why not pick something positive? If no one knows anything, then how can you even know anything?But you don't need to study this yourself. All you have to do is think back to your past self, let's say ten years ago. Did that person have a belief system that you now consider to be faulty? How is that possible? What about your future self? Will that person believe you have a faulty belief system? Probably! How is this possible? How can you be SO WRONG? Is it because you haven't learned? I highly doubt it!But we have to be right! We ARE RIGHT! At least we think we might be . . . maybe?The need to be right is so ingrained within us that we create a huge drama when someone contradicts our beliefs. We end relationships over it! We storm out! We write angry twitter updates.HOW THIS BOOK HAS PERSONALLY HELPED ME:- No one person's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what I can do, even if this person is an authority figure- No one group's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what I can do- No one has a clear idea of who or what I am, not even me!- When people talk, they are telling stories. I don't have to argue. I don't have to fight. I simply have to listen. WOW!- I cannot comprehend another person's dream. I can't mind read. I can't assume. I know nothing of their inner workings.- Even scary, aggressive people are just telling stories.- I no longer have to feel ashamed about who I am or what I've done or where I'm going. It's not my job to assign a story to my life, or a judgment.- I no longer have to pretend to be something or hustle to gain love. I just need to love who is willing to love back. It's so simple.- I take all gurus, religions, indictments and gossip with quite a high level of benevolent skepticism, which allows me to be free from the fear that goes along with these stories.- I don't take myself as seriously as I used to.Probably the most valuable of all . . .- I have a deep compassion for all people. We are all just stuck here together, trying our hardest and doing our best. I don't have to hate someone because their best wasn't up to some story I tell myself. I don't' have to insist they believe in my story. I can just smile and listen and do what I can." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

In the opening salvo, he is waiting to be escorted to a literary event, sitting in a hotel lobby, while a woman he is meant to meet is circling the room looking for a woman, mistakenly thinking the author of the book she's read cannot be a man. On the eve of Arthur's fiftieth birthday, his partner of almost ten years has announced his upcoming nuptials, and in order to avoid this nightmare, Arthur has cobbled together a trip around the world accepting an odd congregation of invitations to host, attend, and teach various literary events. With each stop, he goes into his past, revealing more and more about himself and his history. Each experience generates memory, both poignant and absurd. Greer has a fine sense of character and irony, and this surpasses other books I've read by him." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Educated: A Memoir" review="I was enthralled and moved by this powerful memoir.  The author grew up in a survivalist family in Idaho, the youngest child.  She was not homeschooled---instead, she simply didn't go to school at all, due to her father's mistrust of public schools.  Her family didn't believe in modern medicine.  Instead, her mother was an herbalist and midwife.  Her father owned a junkyard.  Her childhood is affected over and over by serious injuries of family members, injuries which are not treated.As Tara gets into her preteen and teen years, one older brother in particular starts tormenting her, and the tormenting rises to the level of hugely severe abuse.  In part in response to this, she decides to go to college, and by pretty much sheer force of will, does well enough on the ACT to get into Brigham Young University.  From there, she starts a storied college career and eventually gets a doctorate from Cambridge.  However, each time she is drawn back to the her family, her brother's abuse continues, and the family denial turns more and more severe.  The memoir becomes a story of her internal struggle---to believe her own version of her life and to have the strength to break away from her past.I've struggled with some issues of my own in remembering the past differently than others, and I well know the feeling that the author has over and over.  One line, reality becomes fluid, hit me very hard.  When you know something happened a certain way, but others can't accept that reality and attempt to change the past by denying it---Tara Westover is able to write about this so powerfully I was crying at points.I hope this book gets wide readership.  It's an amazing glimpse into a way of life that most of us will never know, and an inspiring story of one woman's ability to change her future." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I bought his because I have a beautiful little boy who has some very specialized challenges, and I loved the message this book sends...that you can be different, you can even not be good at certain things in other people's eyes, but there can still be something beautiful only you can contribute.  And I want my son to know and to hear that message that just like Gerald the Giraffe, he's got a very special dance that he'll be able to do.  And I want him to be able to see that it's possible too, because I know sometimes it can be hard, especially when you're in therapy all the time and therapy is all about what's not going well and what's not going like normal, so I truly think this book has great value especially for kiddos who may struggle to do things the way other people normally do.  It sends a very nice yes you can message, and I love it." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="P is for Potty! (Sesame Street) (Lift-the-Flap)" review="My 19 month old daughter now recognizes Elmo and so I thought getting a potty themed book to introduce her to the idea of going to the potty would be great. However, I was disappointed when I got the book because even though it says it is targeted for ages 1-3, it is not well written for that age group. P is for Potty sounds like a board book that would be simple, direct, and to the point, so I was surprised when I opened it up and saw paragraphs. I wish I had seen some previews of the book to realize that it is not a good intro to potty training book for the younger set. My daughter likes looking at the pictures and lifting the flaps, but she cannot sit through reading each page (she becomes impatient to turn the page).The biggest issue I have with this book is that it is too long and there is so much dialogue, making it harder for a child my daughter's age to follow along (There is so much Elmo says .... and Albie says ..... and Elmo's mommy says ....). It may have worked better if the author simply told the story instead of all the talking by different characters. It also doesn't have the word repetition that you find in other toddler board books. I also felt there was something about the vocabulary used in the book that made it more complicated than other books targeted for the 1-3 year old range.In my opinion that storyline is too long and there is too much going on for a 1-3 year old to follow, especially if you want it to be an introduction to potty training (versus a storybook for a child who is at the tail end of potty training and has the occasional accident). Here is the storyline/plot: Elmo and his mom are babysitting Elmo's cousins, Albie and baby Jo Jo. The baby is fussing because he is wet and needs a diaper change. He gets a diaper change while Albie announces twice that he used to wear diapers but is now learning to use the potty. They have lunch and then Elmo uses the big toilet in the bathroom and they show the steps (wiping, flushing, washing hands). Albie doesn't need to use the little potty. They play in the sandbox and then Albie has an accident and changes into dry clothes. He is reassured by Elmo's mom that it is ok. Later, Albie successfully uses the little potty. Then Albie gets picked up by his mom and tells her all about his day.In terms of the quality of the book, the pages are much thinner than the typical board book. As others have mentioned, even though it now has over 30 flaps to lift, they are unrelated to the potty and the storyline, and are really just an added distraction if you are wanting to use this book as an educational tool about potty training. They are great activities for learning before and after (for example, a lamp that is off and then you flip the tab and it is now on or blocks that are stacked up high and you flip the flap and they are knocked over).In conclusion, had I seen a copy of this book before I purchased it (such as a look inside preview that some books have on Amazon), I wouldn't have purchased this for my daughter. I've included some photos of the inside of the pages so that others can take a glance before they decide to purchase." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="How to Win Friends & Influence People" review="My Dad gave me a copy of this when I graduated highschool in the 90s but I wasn't ready for it yet, I don't even think I read it to be honest. Now I'm 37 and realizing that I've put my personal growth on the back burner for entirely too long. I had pretty much given up on making new adult friends. I had actually self-diagnosed myself with Asperger's because I was having such a difficult time trying to figure out why people (including myself) do the things that do. The realization that my marriage was being effected by my nearly empty toolbox of social skills promoted me to take personal responsibility and shoulder the blame myself for once instead of blaming everyone around me for everything. I grew up with a hypercritical Mother so I think I had promised myself that I would never be criticized again, even if that meant writing people off the instant I felt like I had made myself vulnerable enough to be hurt by them.  I couldn't find the copy that my dad gave me so I ordered a new one and chapter 1 alone is changing the way I look at EVERYTHING. I've been plagued with mild depression/anxiety for 20 years and I'm realizing that I've developed some unhealthy defense mechanisms to cope with these issues. I never turned to drugs or alcohol, but the fortress-like walls I've constructed to deal with criticism (real or perceived) aren't much better for me. I've re-read and taken notes on the first section of the book several times now and my wife is noticing and she seems quite relieved, i had no idea I could impact another persons life so strongly.  Like I said, I am only getting started with the book and it has already helped me enough to warrant a 5-star rating. This book has stood the test of time for a reason and I can see why now. The strategies are applicable to and helpful in all aspects of my life so far, from my marriage to my job, and even to the way I interact with clerks in gas stations. I've read numerous self help books in the past, seen a therapist for 3 years, been through the gauntlet of antidepressants, etc, and until now I thought I was wasting my time. I've been learning things all along, but I never learned how to actually apply the things I had learned until now. This book speaks my language and if your background sounds even remotely similar I have a feeling that you'll agree." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Player's Handbook (Dungeons & Dragons)" review="I am going to try to not duplicate the information provided in most of the other 5 star reviews because I agree with the vast majority of them.  I am an oldster, have played every edition of D&D; there has been, most of them being released when I was of legal drinking age, and IMO this is the best edition ever.  I have not been this excited about a version of D&D; since 2nd edition was released.  It appears to me to have taken all the best, from a game design point of view, and most popular aspects of earlier editions and put them in one book.  Another way to think of it is that this edition is the most true to the game principles set forth in the earlier editions, especially AD&D; 1st and 2nd editions, while at the same time carrying the more modern and popular principles from 3.5 and even the much maligned 4.0.I have to admit that I completely steered clear of the earlier play test versions, and was more than a little skeptical of the approach taken in getting feedback from so many play testers.  I was worried that we would end up with a too many cooks spoil the stew situation; a game that was a convoluted mish-mash of everyone's favorite rules creating an incoherent and largely unplayable mess.  I am pleasantly surprised to say that I was 100% wrong about the effectiveness of the play test process and the finished product.  Contrary to the opinions in some of the lower star reviews, what I am holding in my hands and have read cover to cover is a very tight, comprehensive, elegant, and fun set of rules.Who is likely to like these rules?  I think both the veteran player who cut his or her teeth on any version before 3.0, and a brand new player will like them.  The mechanics most definitely have a return to the basics that made the game great in the 70's and 80's feel, while at the same time keeping a more elegant version of the more modern mechanics, like feats, attacks of opportunity, etc., that people generally love from 3.0 and later editions.  For the most part, all of these things have been streamlined and made more elegant in application, but they are there.I will end with my favorite thing about this book.  A little background first to provide some context for my opinion.  And let me say that this is just my opinion and some will disagree with me.  For me, D&D; started to trend downward in my enjoyment of the game at 2nd edition, and then it really did so at 3.0 and 3.5.  For me, although I did not have the strong dislike for 4.0 that many people did, it just was not D&D; to me anymore, I think primary because I had cut my teeth so much on 1st edition and the Basic and Expert sets in particular.  D&D; 5th edition has produced a steep positive trend for me for I think one general reason.  When playing even 2nd edition, but very much so for 3.0, 3.5, and even 4.0, I found myself interacting with my character in the game more as a playing piece than a character in a story.  Concerns about where to put skill points, and if a particular collection and order of choice for Feats began to dominate my thoughts and game choices.  It was almost as if my character, and my decisions about playing the character, began to be dominated more by my interface with the rules in the book, rather than with my ideas about my character and my interaction with the game world.  As my character advanced in level, I found that my focus on the book and what was written therein became more pronounced, not less as it did with earlier editions.  As I reflected while playing these later editions, I found that I was not really playing a character, but instead was playing a set of rules.  So far, the gift that 5th edition has given to me is a change in focus.  My character has again become a protagonist in an adventure story, rather than a playing piece.  I worry now more about the choices and decisions I make while interacting with the game world, and those choices making the character fun to play, rather than fretting over whether or not I have chosen the right Feats or if my modifier for a particular skill is as high as I want it to be.  The way that races, and even classes, are discussed, the used of a character's background and the ideals, personality characteristics, etc. that are randomly determined from the background choice, and the lack of mathematical modifiers except for the familiar ability modifier, and the soon to be ubiquitous global proficiency modifier, instead using the elegant advantage/disadvantage mechanic all have worked to focus my attention back on my character as protagonist.  For that I want to thank the play testers and writers of 5th edition.  For me this has been the most nostalgic aspect of the rules, not so much the mechanics per se.Do I like all of the rules?  Absolutely not.  Frankly, I think that is impossible to attain and do not expect that from any set of rpg rules.  To me that's not fair to expect that of the writers.  And frankly, I am not even looking for that in a set of rules anymore.  As I start down the path of the twilight of my gaming career given my age, I want a set of rules that provides enough structure that a DM can make consistent rulings on the fly that fit in with the general mechanics used in the game, and that foster my appreciation as a player of the development of my character in a game world where playing the game is smooth and produces memories of an interesting character who is the protagonist in an interesting story line.  Most importantly, I want a set of rules that stays out of the way of that process, and helps me to focus on the game aspects that will produce those kinds of memories.For me, D&D; 5th edition, although not perfect, will accomplish this just fine." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I work in a Title I school, where we are really focusing on getting all of our students to succeed- via whatever path they choose after high school.  Many of our children had never been out of the county before this year, when we took them on a field trip across the state to a zoo.  I feel like this book not only encourages them, but also kind of gives them a heads up of the reality of later life.  Sometimes you aren't on top of the world, and you do get lost, and you do have to keep going to try to get out of your rut.  And you don't want to be caught with the people who are just waiting around...we want them to be proactive and do something about it.  I save up all year and purchase each of my students a copy and write a note to them individually, so that they know that they have someone who is in their corner, really pushing for them.  That being said, I also read this to my own small children- because they just really enjoy the story, and all of the pictures." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup" review="This is an impeccably researched and referenced account of the Theranos saga. As a long-time observer and sometime competitor of Theranos I watched this tale unfold whilst working at a couple of established IVD companies. Everyone I knew who had ever developed an assay or instrument knew this was smoke and mirrors, impossibly too good to be true. What I never suspected was just how personally dishonest EH had been, and for how long the complex deception was maintained. Whilst I've met a few egregious individuals working for big companies, there are enough checks and balances (QA/RA, Med/Sci Affairs, CLSs and other professionals etc) in place to stop harmful devices getting out the door.The subject matter - developing devices and assays - is a complex dry topic, difficult to write engagingly about. But JC does a workmanlike job and I read this in one go after its midnight Kindle release. My only nit to pick is the poor editing: there are so many uses of '....named....' as in 'an engineer named John Smith' or 'a restaurant named Joe's Bar' that it got irritating. Find/replace 'named' with a comma would have worked fine in most cases. The text was also repetitive - eg '...an award named after Channing...' gets at least 2 mentions. But not enough to lose a star.Kudos to the good people at Theranos who had the courage to get the story out and for JCs persistence into a headwind of legalistic intimidation. I've heard Theranos is now a case-study for MBA students: this book should be required reading for anyone thinking about 'disrupting' the medical devices industry.

I discovered Ketogenic Dieting in mid February of this year. I spent more than two weeks watching between 20 and 25 hours on youtube about this subject, and read many articles both pro, and con.Why all the research? I'm 64 years old and was pretty terrified at the prospect of eating this way. I also don't have a gallbladder to assist in fat assimilation.  With cancer, diabetes, heart attacks and strokes on both sides of my family, I really didn't want to make any mistakes.In the 19 years I've been a member of Amazon, I've never once “Pre-ordered” anything, with the exception of this book. What sold me on this book was watching and listening to several dozen of Leanne's youtube video's and podcast postings. I found all of her information to be extremely well researched, and she consistently provided far more useful and important health information, of a higher value, than even most of the medical doctors who've posted on the same subjects. I decided to give it a shot, but still with some reluctance, as eating this way is totally counter intuitive to the way I've eaten for the last 40 years.Leanne has a funny sense of humor in both her video's and in her writing style. She's as delightful to read as she is to watch. I have followed her instructions for the last 6 weeks or so, and have effortlessly lost over 30 pounds. I have felt fully supported by her advice, including her suggestion of taking Ox Bile and Essential Enzymes to help with fat digestion, for those of us without a gallbladder. I haven't felt this great in many years, and will continue to eat this way from now on.If you're on a limited income as I am, and can only afford to purchase one or two books on this subject, drop this book in your cart. I have no doubt that you'll be very glad you did. Thank you, and thank you Leanne. This is truly a wonderful and life changing book.Updated - 3/1/18Before I get going and because of a comment posted below, I need to say that I have no connection with the publisher of this book. I don't know Leanne, any of her friends or anyone connected with the publishing of this book, The book was not given to me so I'd give it a nice review. I purchased it.In the comment section below, M.Kent suggested an update. When I went on this diet I was 6'4'' and was pushing 265 lbs. I wasn't hugely fat, just what people referred to as “really frigging large.” With the exception of my ex-mother-in-law who once told me, “Oh my God, you're enormous.” Sigh.I'm still 6'4'' (of course) but I weigh 225 lbs. I went on this diet not just lose weight, but to avoid some of the above stated illnesses that my family has experienced, mostly from a lack of solid health and nutritional information. God bless the internet.I will continue to eat this way because I feel and look healthier. I also noticed a reduction in the inflammation from the osteoarthritis in my spine. I don't eat sugar or sweets of any kind, and keep my carbs below 20 or 25 grams a day. I don't drive myself crazy anymore tracking macros or compulsively counting calories. Between protein and fat, getting enough fat was more of a challenge for me. I eat lots of Kerry Gold butter, Coconut oil, heavy cream, olive oil and lots of avocados. I occasionally use MCT oil.I plan to take my weight down to about 210 lbs by June or July. I've also integrated intermittent fasting into the mix. I eat during a four hour “eating window.” and have started doing a 72 hour fast once every three months. Leanne addresses fasting in her book.Being seriously committed to this type of eating, I've found it helpful to have a ketone blood tester to check on where I'm at, at different points. The breath and urine testers are a waste of money if you want accurate testing. The tester I found, and believe is the most accurate and least expensive is called Keto Mojo. It tests both ketones and glucose and if you purchase it from them, you're guaranteed to be able to purchase ketone test strips for only .99 cents, instead of the $2.00 to $7.00 each, as I've seen them listed for on the internet.Here are some other things I've found useful, on what first seemed like an odd journey of eating fat to be healthy.Greater Goods Nourish Digital Kitchen Food Scale. Great scale for the price, considering all it does. Available on Amazon. https://www.amazon.com/Greater-Goods-Nourish-Portions-Nutritional/dp/B00O5U4NDQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1518967663&sr;=8-3&keywords;=Greater+Goods+Nourish+Digital+Kitchen+Food+ScaleNuton MCT Oil which is both C10 and C8. I also sometimes use a C8  MCT Oil which is 99.6% C8 and is a  bit more expensive. Both available on AmazonI've also found a short mimicking fasting diet, to be very helpful to getting fat adapted within a short period of time, without the hinderence of “keto flu.” One or two avocados and one or two greens drinks a day, launched my blood ketones from 0 to 4.2 mmol/L in only four days.The only other book I purchased, and only for the very serious is, The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living by Stephen Phinney, MD, PhD and Jeff Volek, PhD, RD.Everybody and every body is different and it takes a bit of experimentation to figure out what combination of these techniques (if any) are right for you. Take your time and have a good time with it. I hope this was helpful. I'm sorry it was so long.Best Wishes,Scott" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I've looked at several preschool workbooks and this one is great at establishing pre-writing skills before diving into drawing letters and numbers.  It has a nice slow pace and isn't overly complicated like several other books I looked at.  The color graphics on each page are bright and engaging.  It has just the right amount of material per page in my opinion.  Pages can be torn out and put in page protectors so they can be used multiple times.  I hope the pictures I added give you a sense of how great this book really is so you can stop reading reviews and buy it already!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Too much needed explanation and background, and then the points made were so blatant and in-your-face, I felt that the story was just an excuse to make these points (not that I disagreed with her, but it didn't feel like good, flowing, natural sounding story-telling). I'm sorry about this, as I couldn't wait to read another book by this author, as I thought her first book was genius." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I was drawn fully into the story, set in both the 1930s and present day.  It follows the story of the Foss children in the '30s and Avery Stafford in present day, and brings to light a horrifying and shameful real-life scandal.From the '30s to 1950, a woman named Georgia Tann, who ran the (Memphis) Tennessee Children's Home Society, stole poor children from their families and newborn babies from single mothers and sold them to celebrities, politicians and others who could afford them.  It was all done under the guise of helping orphaned and abandoned children find good homes, but it was actually human trafficking.Avery Stafford finds a puzzling photograph that leads her into an ever more confusing story of secrets and lies inside her upright, respected family.  Along the way, she starts to question the man her family has picked for her to marry and her expected role within the family.  What follows is a heartwarming story of love, betrayal, memories and staying true to your heart.  In addition to the well developed characters and background love story, I liked the realistic view into the 1930s.I really enjoyed this book and learned a lot about a dark time in our history, when being poor was enough to have a family ripped apart forever." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

All I can say is I had never heard of it until my wife got pregnant and I began looking into books for babies/toddlers. This was at the top of my list after researching, and I'm so happy to have purchased it. The art, wording, alternating black and white with color pages, and storyline are wonderful. It engages my son, he loves looking at the bunnies, and it truly is a calming book for everyone before bedtime. This was written over 60 years ago, so it makes you feel a bit like you're in a bygone era. Simplicity, values, family and education are all focused on in this book. We've been reading it weekly for the past 20 months, and will continue to do so for another 40! I highly recommend this book, along with other Margaret Wise Brown books." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Summer Bridge Activities®, Grades 2 - 3" review="Simply put, this is a great activity book to help your child stay mentally active when out of school for the summer.  It is not intended to be a full school curriculum, but instead a way to keep children mentally active during the summer break.  We have a child leaving 2nd and heading to 3rd grade and were concerned about her skills being lost over the summer.  While we do work with her to increase her skillset, we were more concerned about the atrophy that happens when not in school than jumping her ahead.  It can be a bit tough for kids returning to school if they go 2-3 months with little book work, so we wanted to help keep her fresh but not fill her summer with full days of 'school' work.This book is a solid mix of skills with some being easy and others more of stretch.  The easy and stretch items will vary with the schooling your child gets and their abilities.  I suspect most kids heading to third grade will find most of the work in this book at least a strong refresher and potentially help move them in some areas.  This is setup to be a roughly 15 minute daily regime but we have enhanced it with some other work.  We have math and science specific activity books as well as a reading workbook that we rotate into the mix.  We also keep track of words she has a harder time spelling and use them make a 10 spelling word weekly review and test (review for 4 days and test on the fifth).  Most of these topics are in the bridge activities book, but we felt a little extra attention would not hurt and some variety in what she is working on keeps things fresh.  We do spelling, reading/writing and a couple 'pages' of work each weekday which comes out to about a 45-60 minute batch of work.  The Summer Bridge Activities books is a constant in the mix with a page used almost every day and the other work rotated." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Handmaid's Tale" review="I first read The Handmaid's Tale around the time it was published in 1986. I was just 22, a sheltered young thing. I recall wondering what everyone was raving about, since only the top story layer of the book connected for me. Now, with decades of life experience behind me, I see that this is a deeply moving, complex book. I'm so glad I decide to read again just at this moment in time.You would think that something written thirty years ago would seem dated. But that wasn't the case for me. If anything, I think there are so many things imagined in the book which have become more possible today instead of less. In a sense, this is a cautionary tale that a large art of the population ignored or misunderstood.More than ever, we should be reading this and sharing it with the young women in our lives. And discussing it with them, so they see more of the depth than my 22-year-old self did.Margaret Atwood imagined a world where a totalitarian power went into action against foreign zealots and their own people's wanton behavior. This power was meant to make the world better, but it also created a world of highly distinct haves and have nots.She says, “Better never means better for everyone... It always means worse, for some.” It might be just me (although I suspect not) but this sure sounds like what we often hear today on the news and in conversations.Reading this at the end of 2016 after a brutal election cycle, the following quote from Atwood seems both wise and horrible. Have we not been hearing about people who feel invisible?“We were the people who were not in the papers. We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. It gave us more freedom. We lived in the gaps between the storiesAtwood's Republic of Gilead gives people one-dimensional functions. Correction - she gives women one-dimensional functions. They are Wives, Marthas, Handmaids, Aunts, or Unwomen (and a few more which would be spoilers). Unwomen are rebels, likely to be banished to the toxic waste dumps of the colonies. Everyone else plays a part in the singular female focus - procreation. As I read, I wondered what category I'd fall into should I have the bad luck to land in Gilead. The women there have no layers of life or experience. They are expected only to fulfill their narrow role.Why is procreation such a focus? Because of falling birth rates among white people. This book doesn't discuss race except one small spot near the end. It's as if there is only one race in Gilead. And the only people in that race with any power are men.The main character, Offred (literally of Fred named after the Commander she serves) is the perfect blend of weak and strong. She tells us of her past and says, “When we think of the past it's the beautiful things we pick out. We want to believe it was all like that.” But her life is not beautiful. And Atwood straddles the line of past and present, sending back and forth in a way that keeps you wanting more. Just as Offred wants more. Just as we all want more for ourselves and the generations of women coming after us.If you read this book long ago, pick it up again. If you haven't yet read it, move it up to the top of your TBR. Buy it for friends. Buy for your sons and daughters. Use it to teach and to learn what kind of world we could be if we stop valuing the diversity of all people." data-balloon="See users review on this product."
