Personally, it has helped me focus on the one person who is the LAST to get my attention and effort. Myself.In each chapter, Rachel starts with a lie you tell yourself, provides examples from her own life illustrating it, then lists the tools she used (or wished she had) that help overcome the lie. She writes as if she's your bestie giving advice and sometimes tough love over a VLC (vodka la croix). She's honest, vulnerable and nerdy which I found made her stories endearing. The first chapter begins, I peed my pants last week. She's not afraid to share embarrassing stories and an incredibly painful history to connect with readers. It all seems to stem from her passion for people to grow and an attempt to create a culture where women from all walks of life hold each other up rather than tear each other down. That's a world I want to live in.Though Rachel is a Christian and I'm an atheist, I did not find her mentions of her faith to be overly preachy. Her advice does not depend on one particular belief system. For example, 5 to Thrive is practical advice for any person. 5 to Thrive has changed my life. The idea is that you do these 5 things every day for 30 days: 1. Drink half your body weight in ounces of water. 2. Exercise for 30 minutes. 3. Wake up an hour early using the hour for yourself. 4. Give up 1 food or category of food. 5. List 10 things you're grateful for from that day. Waking an hour early was the most challenging, but I found it was the most beneficial. Now each day I start feeling productive and ready for anything. My attitude has changed, my health has improved, and I'm more intentional with my family as a result of dwelling on my many blessings. After applying this strategy for more than 30 days, it's no longer a strategy but a lifestyle.Ultimately, reading this book will not change your life. No person, no book, no thing can fix what is broken for you. Rachel writes, Only you have the power to change your life. This book can give you the tools that you need to reach your goals and make lasting change to live your best life, but it's up to you to make it happen. She writes, Please stop telling yourself you deserve this life. Please stop justifying a continued crappy existence simply because that's the way it's always been. Just as you've chosen to stay in this place for so long, you can choose too to get yourself out of it. It's what I needed to hear at this time in my life and I recommend this book to others who may need additional encouragement or direction." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I don't read Patterson, and adding Clinton to the cover added to my reluctance. However, the reviews were surprisingly consistent and good, so I thought I'd at least wade in, if only for amusement. Well, two days of intense reading later, and I can say that the reviews are right -- the book is consistently good, with a propulsive plot, believable characters, a good balance of detail and pacing, and some cards played at the end that make it all come together nicely. While there is a quality of reveal to it that sometimes makes it feel a little too tidy for a minute or two, the pacing keeps you moving, and it's a great, fun read." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Before this book, I really didn't fully understand what a Ketogenic Diet was.  Chapter 1 defines it for me in 4 words, Low-Carb, High-Fat.  This diet promotes fresh whole foods and healthy fats & oils, and cuts out processed, chemically treated foods.  It also tells you that when you start a Keto Diet, you'll most likely experience the Keto-Flu!Chapter 2 - Go Keto in 5 steps.  1-clean out your pantry.  Egads!  No dates or peas, 2 of my favorites!  2-Go shopping and stock up on the basics- water, coffee, tea, spices, herbs, non-sugar sweeteners, lemon & lime juice, mayo, mustard, pesto, sriracha, broths, pickled foods, nuts & seeds, meats, eggs, wild caught fish, nonstarchy veggies, berries, avocados, full fat dairy, avocado oil, olive oil, butter, lard, bacon fat. 3-set up your kitchen with a food scale, food processor, spiralizer, hand mixer, and cast iron pan.  4- plan your meals, and 5 -exercise!Part 2, the 14 day meal plan, not only gives you the meal outline for the week for breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, and dinner, but it gives you the nutritional breakdown of calories, fat, protein, carbs, fiber & net carbs, it then gives you what page to find the recipe on, THEN it gives you a weekly shopping list!

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos" review="Jordan Peterson is a beacon of light in this chaotic world, a psychologist whose writing combines science and common sense. One of his talents is his ability to articulate complex ideas to a wide audience. Regardless of whether you have a background in psychology or not, you will understand this book. It covers his twelve rules for life, which are intended not only as a guide for life of the individual, but as a remedy for society’s present ills. Peterson believes that the cure for society starts with curing the individual, the smallest unit of society. Peterson’s well-known advice to clean your room is a reflection of the truth that if you can’t even manage the most basic and mundane responsibilities of life, then you have no business dictating to others how to fix society.One of the main themes of this book is: Personal change is possible. There's no doubt you can be slightly better today than you were yesterday. Because of Pareto's Principle (small changes can have disproportionately large results), this movement towards the good increases massively, and this upward trajectory can take your life out of hell more rapidly than you could believe. Life is tragic and full of suffering and malevolence. But there's something you can start putting right, and we can't imagine what good things are in store for us if we just fix the things that are within our power to do so.The 12 Rules for Life:In Peterson’s own words, it’s 12 rules to stop you from being pathetic, written from the perspective of someone who himself tried to stop being pathetic and is still working on it. Peterson is open about his struggles and shortcomings, unlike many authors who only reveal a carefully curated façade.Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back. People have bad posture, and the meaning behind it can be demonstrated by animal behaviors. Peterson uses the example of the lobster. When a lobster loses a fight, and they fight all the time, it scrunches up a little. Lobsters run on serotonin and when he loses, levels go down, and when he wins, levels go up and he stretches out and is confident. Who cares? We evolutionarily diverged from lobsters 350 million years ago, but it’s still the same circuit. It’s a deep instinct to size others up when looking at them to see where they fit in the social hierarchy. If your serotonin levels fall, you get depressed and crunch forward and you’re inviting more oppression from predator personalities and can get stuck in a loop. Fixing our posture is part of the psycho-physiological loop that can help you get started back up again.Rule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping. People often have self-contempt whether they realize it or not. Imagine someone you love and treat well. You need to treat yourself with the same respect. Take care of yourself, your room, your things, and have respect for yourself as if you’re a person with potential and is important to the people around you. If you make a pattern of bad mistakes, your life gets worse, not just for you, but for the people around you. All your actions echo in ways that cannot be imagined. Think of Stalin’s mother and the mistakes she made in life, and how the ripple effects went on to affect the millions of people around him.Rule 3: Choose your friends carefully. It is appropriate for you to evaluate your social surroundings and eliminate those who are hurting you. You have no ethical obligation to associate with people who are making your life worse. In fact, you are obligated to disassociate with people who are trying to destroy the structure of being, your being, society’s being. It’s not cruel, it’s sending a message that some behaviors are not to be tolerated.Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today. You need to improve, and you may even be in real bad shape, but many unfairly compare themselves to some more seemingly successful person. Up till around age 17, random comparisons to other people can make sense, but afterwards, especially age 30+, our lives become so idiosyncratic that comparisons with others become meaningless and unhelpful. You only see a slice of their life, a public facet, and are blind to the problems they conceal.Rule 5: Don't let children do things that make you dislike them. You aren't as nice as you think, and you will unconsciously take revenge on them. You are massively more powerful than your children, and have the ability and subconscious proclivity for tyranny deeply rooted within you.If you don't think this is true, you don't know yourself well enough. His advice on disciplinary procedure: (1) limit the rules. (2) use minimum necessary force and (3) parents should come in pairs.It's difficult and exhausting to raise children, and it's easy to make mistakes. A bad day at work, fatigue, hunger, stress, etc, can make you unreasonable.Rule 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world. Life is tragic and there's malevolence. There's plenty to complain about, but if you dwell on it, you will become bitter and tread down a path that will take you to twisted places. The diaries of the Columbine killers are a chilling look into minds that dwelled on the unholy trinity of deceit, arrogance, and resentment) . So instead of cursing the tragedy that is life, transform into something meaningful. Start by stop doing something, anything, that you know to be wrong. Everyday you have choices in front of you. Stop doing and saying things that make you weak and ashamed. Do only those things that you would proudly talk about in public.Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient). Meaning is how you protect yourself against the suffering that life entails. This means that despite the fact that we’re all emotionally wounded by life, we’ve found something that makes it all worthwhile. Meaning, Peterson says, is like an instinct, or a form of vision. It lets you know when you’re in the right place, and he says that the right place is midway between chaos and order. If you stay firmly ensconced within order, things you understand, then you can’t grow. If you stay within chaos, then you’re lost.  Expediency is what you do to get yourself out of trouble here and now, but it comes at the cost of sacrificing the future for the present. So instead of doing what gets you off the hook today, aim high. Look around you and see what you can make better. Make it better. As you gain knowledge, consciously remain humble and avoid arrogance that can stealthily creep on you. Peterson also says to be aware of our shortcomings, whatever they may be; our secret resentments, hatred, cowardice, and other failings. Be slow to accuse others because we too conceal malevolent impulses, and certainly before we attempt to fix the world.Rule 8: Tell the truth—or, at least, don't lie. Telling the truth can be hard in the sense that it’s often difficult to know the truth. However, we can know when we’re lying. Telling lies makes you weak. You can feel it, and others can sense it too. Meaning, according to Peterson, is associated with truth, and lying is the antithesis of meaning. Lying disassociates you with meaning, and thus reality itself. You might get away with lying for a short while, but only a short time. In Peterson’s words “It was the great and the small lies of the Nazi and Communist states that produced the deaths of millions of people.”Rule 9: Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't. A good conversation consists of you coming out wiser than you went into it. An example is when you get into an argument with your significant other, you want to win, especially if you get angry. If you’re more verbally fluent than the other person then you can win. One problem is that the other person might see something better than you, but they can’t quite articulate it as well. Always listen because there’s a possibility they’re going to tell you something that will prevent you from running headfirst into a brick wall. This is why Peterson says to listen to your enemies. They will lie about you, but they will also say true things about yourself that your friends won’t. Separate the wheat from the chaff and make your life better.Rule 10: Be Precise in Your Speech: There is some integral connection between communication and reality (or structures of belief as he likes to say). Language takes chaos and makes it into a ‘thing.’ As an example, imagine going through a rough patch in your life where you can’t quite put your finger on what’s wrong. This mysterious thing that’s bothering you—is it real? Yes, if it’s manifesting itself as physical discomfort. Then you talk about it and give it a name, and then this fuzzy, abstract thing turns into a specific thing. Once named, you can now do something about it. The unnameable is far more terrifying than the nameable. As an example, the movie the Blair Witch project didn’t actually name or describe the evil. Nothing happens in the movie, it’s all about the unnameable. If you can’t name something, it means it’s so terrifying to you that you can’t even think about it, and that makes you weaker. This is why Peterson is such a free speech advocate. He wants to bring things out of the realm of the unspeakable. Words have a creative power and you don’t want to create more mark and darkness by imprecise speech.Rule 11: Don’t bother children when they are skateboarding. This is mainly about masculinity. Peterson remembers seeing children doing all kinds of crazy stunts on skateboards and handrails, and believes this is an essential ingredient to develop masculinity, to try to develop competence and face danger. Jordan Peterson considers the act of sliding down a handrail to be brave and perhaps stupid as well, but overall positive. A lot of rebellious behavior in school is often called ‘toxic masculinity,’ but Peterson would say to let them be. An example would be a figure skater that makes a 9.9 on her performance, essentially perfect. Then the next skater that follows her seems to have no hope. But she pushes herself closer to chaos, beyond her competence, and when successful, inspires awe. Judges award her 10’s. She’s gone beyond perfection into the unknown and ennobled herself as well as humanity as well.Rule 12: Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street. This chapter is mainly autobiographical and he writes about tragedy and pain. When tragic things are in front of you and you’re somewhat powerless, you must keep your eyes open for little opportunities that highlight the redemptive elements of life that make it all worthwhile. The title of this chapter comes from his experience of observing a local stray cat, and watching it adapt to the rough circumstances around it. Another thing you must do when life is going to pieces is to shorten your temporal horizon. Instead of thinking in months, you maybe think in hours or minutes instead. You try to just have the best next minute or hour that you can. You shrink the time frame until you can handle it, this is how you adjust to the catastrophe. You try to stay on your feet and think.  Although this chapters deals about harsh things, it’s an overall positive one. Always look for what’s meaningful and soul-sustaining even when you’re where you’d rather not be." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Plant Paradox: The Hidden Dangers in Healthy Foods That Cause Disease and Weight Gain" review="The idea behind the book is intriguing and I'm going to try it for a few months.However, the book is PAINFUL to read. There are a few concepts that he covers over and over and over again using different levels of details and horrible examples. He compares your gut bacteria to a neighborhood, to animals, and other things that are too ridiculous to consider. It's like he explains everything at the lowest possible level but also at a highly scientific level. 5 different ways and all over the book. He is repeatedly being redundant again.The book needs to be about 3 chapters long, get to the point, and be done with it. Here it is:1. Lectins are bad. There are 7 deadly disruptors: antibiotics, NSAIDS, stomach acid blockers, artificial sweeteners, hormone disruptors, herbacides, and blue light. For details, see Dr. Gundry's website for deadly-disruptors-plant-paradox.2. Avoid these things in your food by avoiding foods that naturally have lectin-producing parts. Find out what your food ate. Veggies need to be non-GMO, organic, chemical-free. Basically, go to the farmer's market. Organic isn't good enough. Fish need to be wild-caught and fresh. Chicken needs to be pastured, organic, and non GMO. Organic meat can still be fed corn and grains, which are bad for you. Do the best you can with your location and budget. Avoid beef and pork for a while, then eventually get well-sourced clean-eating animals. Avoid sugar, including fruit. Sugar makes you fat. For a list of yes and no foods, see Dr. Gundry's website for plant-paradox-shopping-list.3. Avoid these things in household items. Don't touch thermal receipts. Don't take the medicine listed above. Don't use plastic wrap or Ziploc bags. You already knew not to use Teflon, BPA plastics, or hand sanitizers with triclosan. No sunscreens or deodorant with parabens or aluminum. (He doesn't mention that it's smelly and gorss for about 3 weeks when you switch from aluminum/paraben based deodorants.) Avoid makeup with the same.There are some meal plans in the book that basically result in eating lettuce (the taste of sadness) 5 times a day for the first 3 days. (Uh - NO!) Then there are recipes to help you cheat the plan by making fake muffins and pancakes.Seriously, just eat eggs and sweet potatoes for breakfast. Eat chicken and veggies for lunch. Eat some nuts or avocado for a snack. Eat some fish and veggies for dinner. Feel better." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Hate U Give" review="I had originally said I was not going to read this book, I didn't know how well I would like it, and I don't tend to get involved with things that can make life at work harder for me. I literally work with the police, I am a dispatcher, so it is a huge part of my life. I knew going in it was revolved around the BLM movement, and police brutality and I made the decision to read it anyways. I had heard so many good things about it and I just needed to see for myself. First I want to say, it does not at any point in this book bash police officers. It talks about some of the problems in the world and how things happen but it never attacks or sets out to make them out to monsters. I really liked that because most aren't, they just aren't, they are humans. Now, Starr is the main character who is involved in a horrible tragedy that leaves her friend from child hood Khalil dead by an officer involved shooting. It was horrible and it was really sad. I hated reading it, I cried my eyes out, Thomas did such an amazing job of making a horrible action into beautiful fiction that made you feel like you were right there. I was so broken by this part of the story. Then reading later on into Starr's grief was just hard. I don't know any other way to describe it but there will be tears, so very many tears. That isn't it though, you see her as they have to fight the system basically, and you are with them through all those emotions. Going to the funeral and seeing his family, destroyed, his mother broken, knowing this isn't just something that happens in fiction, you cannot help but be moved. Now there was some real good in this book too, like some parts that I laughed until I cried. The scene when her parents are arguing in the middle of a prayer I have read an thousand times since finishing the book because it is the funnies thing I have ever read. Her parents were amazing by the way, her dad was an ex-con but he loved her, he admitted his mistakes but he was there for her. Their relationship was really touching to read because I have always been really close to my own dad. Then there was her mom, and her Uncle Carlos, who was actually a cop and lived in a really good neighborhood too. This was really refreshing to read because so many books, YA especially make parents out to be monsters that don't care, that aren't there for their kids. I mean it is like a troupe or something for these stories and it isn't actually the norm and gets annoying to read, so this book did an amazing job with the parents and family. All around though this story just floored me, it gave me a perspective I have never considered before, offered insights into a world I am not a part of, and I loved every minute of it. I don't know what it is to watch one friend die by violence of any sort, much less two in the time of my life and I am 26, she is a teenager. It is jarring to see that as someones existence when it is not your own. It taught me to open my eyes... I love it... Honestly I just wanted to pick it right back up and read it again." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life" review="As someone who has given far too many f***s about far too many things their entire life, this book was exactly the wake up call I needed. Even as a child in elementary school, I would have a miniature meltdown when I got a bad grade or if a friend was mean to me that day. As an adult, I got better at hiding these emotional upheavals and intense reactions to the world around me, but they never really went away with my maturity like I had hoped. I took to heart every disheartening news article I read and every crappy thing that happened to me at work or in school. I'd let it consume me, because I was never told to live life any other way or that controlling my reactions was even remotely possible; I thought it was just a permanent part of my personality. I always knew that it was more of a vice than a virtue, but I felt like I couldn't fully control it.Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*** employs a witty use of profanity laced with satirical comedy that's bursting with philosophical wisdom. Much of Manson's inspiration originates from nihilists, Buddhists, Albert Camus, and Charles Bukowski, but he brings those philosophies into a more modern and palatable perspective. He reminds us that life is too short to react so passionately about every little thing. We have a limited emotional capacity, and we often squander it on reactions to mean-spirited people or unfortunate events, completely forgetting that, although we can't control the world around us, we can control ourselves. This book has empowered me to exercise control over my reactions.Shortly after reading this book, my husband commented at how zen I've become. I'm no longer angrily venting to him about all of the various ways the world upsets me. I still allow myself to feel and talk about things that bother me (I'm not aiming to achieve nirvana as a Buddhist monk), but petty things no longer have a hold on me. I let the negativity wash over me now without letting it absorb into my soul, and my life has been much more enjoyable as a result.I was so inspired by this book and its philosophy, that I wanted a permanent reminder for myself to further ensure that I use my f***s wisely from now onward. For my birthday, I got this simple, but meaningful tattoo on my right wrist. The ∞ symbol reminds me of the infinite nature of time and outer space, and the 0 on the bottom represents humanity's relevance to time and space as a whole. It can also be translated as don't make something (∞) out of nothing (0) or a reminder that there are infinite opportunities to give a f***, but that I will remain steadfast in giving 0 f***s about things that don't really matter.If you're the type of person who's struggled to keep their temper in line or if you're like me and you find yourself on an emotional roller-coaster because you take every event in the world and within your own life to heart, I strongly encourage you to read this book. If profanity is so much of a problem for you, that you can't tolerate reading the first half of this book (the last half is much less profane) you're probably too narrow-minded to have taken away any of the many philosophical benefits this book offers." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Magnolia Table: A Collection of Recipes for Gathering" review="My husband bought this book for me for Mother’s Day. I had no idea what to expect and I’m delighted with it. It’s a collection of their family recipes from both sides, so it’s a great blend of mostly southern comfort food, with a few Syrian and Korean dishes with a family friendly, yet sophisticated vibe. Her recipes are easy, flavorful, and call for everyday ingredients. I think she has a slight crush on Gruyere cheese. I’m fine with that because I do, too.My thoughts and pics of the dishes we’ve tried:1-2) Gaines Brothers Burgers – p 81 with Bacon-Tomato Sweet Drip Jam – p 82. These were great burgers! They were huge, so next time, I’m making them 6 oz each instead of nearly 11! The tomato drip jam makes enough to make this dinner twice. I considered scaling it back, but I’m so glad I didn’t because it’s soooo good!3) Layered Arugula Salad with Pear Vinaigrette – p 121. Beautiful and lovely flavor balance. The punch of the blue cheese is perfect against the sweet pears and candied walnuts, and the tart pomegranate arils are a nice contrast.4-5) Stew with Jalapeño Cornbread – p 261. This is delicious. The beef stew has tons of flavor. The cornbread isn’t sweetened at all beyond corn’s natural sweetness. The corn kernels, jalapeños, and pimentos make it really yummy, and not too spicy, and the texture’s great. This dinner’s a total keeper.6-7) Buttermilk Blueberry Puff – p 291. So rich and sweet. This is easy peasy, but a wonderfully decadent croissant bread pudding for brunch. (I think she has it in desserts.) I prepped it the night before and let it come to room temperature while I gave the oven plenty of time to preheat. It added a few minutes to the baking time, but worked really well.8) Potato Gratin Mini Stacks – p 179. As yummy as they are cute.9) Beef Tenderloin with Pickled Jalapeno Sour Cream – p 249. This is delicious. The marinade’s great, and we loved the jalapeno sauce.10) Roasted Asparagus with Red Wine Bernaise Sauce – p 163. This was really good. The sauce should be silky. You wont stop whisking to answer your darling child’s text, so you wont break your emulsion, and yours will be much more aesthetically pleasing. Lol!11) I sliced the leftover tenderloin paper thin and piled it on hoagies toasted with butter and garlic salt with a little thin extra sharp cheddar melted on it, and spooned that jalapeno cream over it. That was a fantastic sandwich!I’ll update this as I play in the book more!Some others I have flagged to try: Jojo’s biscuits – p 18 with Bob’s Classic Gravy – p 21 * Garlic Cheese Grits – p 31 * Eggs Benedict Casserole – p 35 * Syrian Donuts – p 45 * Quick Orange Walnut Sweet Rolls – p 57 * Curry Chicken Salad with Toasted Nuts – p 79 * Country Potato Soup with Crumbled Bacon – p 103 * Sausage and Kale Soup – p 109 * White Cheddar Bisque – p 111 * Autumn Butternut Squash Soup – p 113 * Brussels Sprouts Salad – p 115 * Peach Caprese – p 117 * Deviled Eggs – p 133 * Party Queso – p 135 * Baked Brie – p 150 * Sheet Pan Nachos – p 151 * White Bean Hummus – p 153 * Souffled Broccoli Casserole – p 171 * Creamy Squash Casserole with Green Chiles – p 177 * Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas – p 193 * Chicken Pot Pie – p 197 * Dedication Casserole – p 197 * King Ranch Chicken with Mexican-Style Jicama Salad – p 207 * Mom’s Bulgogi with Cucumber Kimchi Salad – p 240 * Jo’s Fatayar with Lebanese Salad – p 244 * Broiled Honey Thyme Peaches with Ice Cream and Aged Balsamic – p 281 * Chocolate Orange Bread Pudding – p 293" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I couldn't put it down. Having been in food service most of my life, I'm only 26yrs old and feel like I've already been exposed to it all. After reading this...not even close. Anthony never goes far beyond the truth of spending his time in a kitchen. Explaining each and every detail about his experiences from culinary school all the way to executive chef running his own restaurant. There's definitely some evil out there, but also many rewards. He tells it how it is. There's plenty of spoilers in this book including talk about what kinds of knives to use, kitchen equipment and about how to improve upon your own skills as a chef, restaurant employee or even an owner. However, this is really a story--not business for dummies. He's done a great job here." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Sharp Objects" review="A caveat:  this is Gillian Flynn's debut novel, published in 2006.  I picked it up because I'd read Gone, Girl--and of course absolutely loved it, beyond anything I would have thought--and then Dark Places.  Gillian Flynn's writing in these books is mesmerizing, as is her ability to craft a story that's just unbelievably outrageous and yet utterly real and convincing at the same time.  In both of her other books I marveled at how  rich the drama was, how complicated, how sick and twisted and yet fully believably human the characters are, all at the same time.  This book, I suppose, is her first...and perhaps that's why I was taken aback.  This isn't a bad read, necessarily, but after the depth and the astounding intricacy of her other two novels, this one certainly didn't captivate me nearly as much.  There were moments of laugh-out-loud humor, of course, and Sharp Objects is still full of twists and turns and uniquely-Gillian-Flynn irony.  I did find myself not engaging as well with the main character, however, nor feeling quite as drawn into the drama.  I perhaps should not be so harsh on an author's first novel--but certainly, her skill and adroitness at weaving a story is markedly more developed in her later works.  I would suggest read Sharp Objects with a little leniency, especially if you've already read Gone, Girl!  (Of course nothing can compare with this classic...)" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Crazy Rich Asians (Crazy Rich Asians Trilogy)" review="SynopsisRachel and Nick have been dating for a while and this summer he wants to take her to his home in Singapore for a friend’s wedding and to meet his family. While they think nothing of spending the summer traveling together, his family, who are “crazy rich” (seriously ridiculously rich) are worried that Nick is going to propose to someone who they have not vetted and is not from a “good” family.Review I started this book thinking it would be about a ton of stereotypes blah blah blah. And that it would be a fluff read – it would take me just a few days to get through a beach read. Alas, I was wrong, but in a good way. I was totally entertained and wanted to read more for multiple reasons. One, Kwan describes some of the houses/treasures of the homes so well that I could imagine just how they looked and it was amazing to be able to see this almost panoramic view of these people’s homes. Two, the characters were well written and entertaining. The only thing I had trouble with was keeping track of who all was who (and thus the family tree in the beginning of the book that I referred back to often once I had “met” so many people). I’m currently waiting for the next book (China Rich Girlfriend) to be available from my library. I totally wanted to roll right into book 2 but I’ll have to wait a bit." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts" review="I was once asked to read this book by the only person in the world I love.....I refused.  At the time I figured it to be some shrinks opinion on how we should all be in our relationships....what the hell does he know I thought.....what if he is wrong and my future wife bases our whole future on just what he says.....I imagined this book to be some guy with opinions on how to fix problems that he knows nothing about because he doesn't know us.  It's not a good feeling as a man to agree to read a book on relationships because you feel like you're putting everything into the authors hands.....and what if he doesn't understand or what if the advice doesn't apply to us.....what if it makes things worse between us because he advises things we don't believe in.....no....I'm not reading that I told her.I thought no matter what we would always figure each other out and we would be ok......I didn't see being asked to read this book , was a cry out from the woman I love hitting a boiling point and her attempt to communicate to me in a different way......the same things she's been trying to for a long time.....Being close minded that day costed me so much regret and misery....I used to wake up to the most beautiful smile in the world and now I don't....I recently ended up reading this book and I couldn't put it down....sounds crazy but it's true.  Instead of being some guys opinions or......typical shrink talk that in no way could apply to each specific relationship.......I found it to be a book that opens up the mind to the understanding of love.....and how it is not this one universal language we all feel we should be the same with.....I once told her....nobody taught me how to love, I'm growing....learning.....I pleased with her to understand I love her.......we simply didn't have an understanding of how and why we didnt approach love the exact same way as each other.....only makes sense that it should be the same right? You bicker and argue and it drives you crazy......why doesn't she understand you think.......the book is not an excuse to use or justify a true bad relationship let me add.....but it truly answers so many questions.....it is really a language of love.  Once understood, this book leaves you feeling like a fool and only wanting to apply so much of what you've now learned to your future together. It takes away the work of trying to understand the things that at the time make no sense.....and allows you to focus on what's important....loving instead of wasting precious time.  Read it carefully and I recommend reading it together.....I didn't get that chance but I can guarantee reading this book with who you love will allow you both to stop frequently throughout the pages and talk,learn,smile, probably cry.....but then go on to a much happier fulfilling life together once the book is closed. It can save so much if you only let it.*Update 12-1-17I drive a bus so I have nothing but time to think as I look out the window and look up at the sky looking around me. You would probably think of screaming kids and noise but for me it is driving in my own little world and using time to think about lifeI am a trainer so I spend my time trying to help people learn how to maintain their body and prevent problems. And the funny thing is that it is are very choices of what we do to our own bodies that I am teaching to have to change. All of our problems nutritionally and physically and even mentally come down too poor choice and repetitive habits that we know we need to change but never do until it's too late. Every single person reading this can relate to thatMy point about what I do is that I spend a lot of time trying to fix my body because professionals out there either won't take the time to do it or I don't have the money to spend on who is needed. I have spent countless months doing stretches and exercises and what I have found is a lot of times I'm doing the exact same stretches and exercises that don't seem to be working. Soooo......why not do different ones then right...... what a lot of reasons it may feel good, you may not know any other stretches or exercises, you may simply believe that if I just do it one more time again tomorrow....THAT it will finally help..... you just believe in that stretch so much that in your mind you just say I'll keep trying. You are maybe even making things worse by this but you're honest to God intentions are to completely cure one of the biggest problems in your life,  pain...... I think you see where I'm getting at.Getting a little long for whoever is reading but there is a lot of meaning here that can help who knows thousands of people as long as this review remains online......I will just end it like this..... last night I took a stretch that I have been doing for over 2 years and I changed it in a slightly different way....... a lot of the pain I normally get daily is gone.......just to put a spotlight on that sentence .....I'm saying that what I had been doing for so long..... trying to cure one of the biggest problems in my life that hadnt been working............that I continued doing........ believing in and depending on.... to be my much needed answer.......It wasn't until I allowed the idea of the same stretch applied in a different way, that I ALLOWED life to be better for me.I did not say this stretch doesn't matter anymore and say forget it to never exist again.....no, I used it to COMMUNICATE with my body in the same exact physical form....just different language from mind to body....because I always believed in it.Belief can be amazing and help you....it also can be your own worst enemy when refuse to change your ways.....lots of time I lost believing my way instead of another.....all while would have given anything to accomplish my goal......once again I stood in my own way......but I didn't give up.....otherwise pain would still be here and I wouldn't have came on here to add all these thoughts.You have to go into the book with an open mind because if you do it with the mindset of wanting it to say what it is that you want to hear.....then you can never let the life-changing words happen.......you're learning a language as you read...not what's right and wrong but what was being lost in life.Keep in mind this is a book about the language of love so if you think about when you go to school to learn a different language...you are taking the difficult step of taking time there in order to understand.....be able to take what you understand and apply it.....and be able to communicate in a NEEDED way once you learn....AND THEN USE......communicate and UNDERSTAND eachother.Just think how you feel when you meet somebody and you want to communicate but you can't and you get frustrated.  you are trying to figure out what you want the other person to know and they're trying to tell or show you..... it becomes stressful and sometimes you end up walking away from each other never knowing the real meaning that was right there between the two of you.  When you are able to speak the same language this simply does not happen.....The same two people if we're able to learn the same language, could come back in front of one another again and.....just imagine......imagine the possibilities with that communication.......so much never lost again.The exact same message and the exact same feelings that were always there, except now instead of the stress of not understanding,  there is the excitement for anything to be possible just by coming together and understanding.....The power of language is amazing........think of when you meet somebody and they're able to speak five or six different languages, you are in awe and wish you could do it.well imagine being able to speak the one language in life that is the most unexplainable, powerful language and meaning of life, love....I would also like to mention the fact that if these two people sat down and learn each other's languages together how helpful that is.....and how much easier it is to be able to learn how to communicate with the exact person that you're trying to ........spending time helping each other learn different languages.......TOGETHER.Bus is parked." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="All We Ever Wanted: A Novel" review="Summary:Have you ever stopped and wondered how you got somewhere? With this man, living this life? Nina Browning should be ecstatic. She is part of the Nashville elite with a charismatic husband and a son that was just accepted into Princeton. It all seems wrong, though. The preoccupation with material wealth, the inability to really connect with her husband or son… this just isn’t who she is. Any of it.Tom is desperately trying to be a good father to Lyla, his beautiful and intelligent daughter. When she got a scholarship to Windsor Academy he is a bit worried, but very proud. Lyla is trying to keep up with her classmates both academically and socially. It’s a different world and sometimes the differences are glaring.A picture snapped in a moment of drunkenness spins out of control. Windsor Academy is going insane with rumors and casting blame. In the eye of the scandal are Tom, Lyla and Nina. Each one is forced to question the relationships of those closest to them, and who they really are.My thoughts:I could not put this book down. It was gorgeously written, and moving. The trio of narratives was an interesting touch. I really enjoyed being able to see more of these characters, their thoughts and motives. These were really interesting, well developed characters. I loved Lyla especially. Tom with the chip on his shoulder and Nina who desperately wants to be seen as a good woman.As far as the plot goes, I found it really intriguing and I loved the different twists and turns that kept me guessing. Through out the book I both loathed and loved certain characters, wanting to believe in them, but not knowing if I can. It’s definitely a different world. I also like how they portrayed the young victim- it was very believable. The horror, shame, inability to believe, and the desire to let it all just fade away. Her strength was also something I really loved. I feel like this book has a lot of adult moments, but also a lot that older teens would like as well. For me, this is a five star book.On the adult content scale, this is pretty high. There’s a lot of language and sexual content as well as drinking. While I would, as I said, see no issue with an older and more mature teen reading it, I have to say it’s meant for adults. I give it an eight.I was lucky enough to receive an eARC of this book from Netgalley and Random House Publishing in exchange for an honest review. My thanks!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

As a former chef, I can scan recipes and know immediately if they are a hit or miss, and I've yet to see a recipe in this book that I won't be excited to create.  Most ingredients will be found right in your neighborhood grocery store, which is another nod to Dr. Gundry's attention to detail.  The recipes vary greatly and will appeal to many different tastes.  Anyone that feels any degree of restriction in following the Plant Paradox protocol will be thrilled to dive into this book and start cooking.  I'm inspired to just cook my way through from beginning to end." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

If you've read other self help books then you probably won't find much that's new here. In fact, it's really the in-your-face tone and humor in her writing that makes this book worthwhile. As for her ideas, I personally found a lot to take issue with. First, she has a very polarized view of spiritual growth that divides our lives in to those that suck and those that are awesome. Maybe that works for young millennials just starting out in life, and if that's the audience she’s g oing for, then great, but most of us are somewhere on a continuum and her assertions that life is either this way or that way are simplistic to say the least. Sincero also uses a lot of highly critical, edgy language to describe people who are struggling or stuck - therefore not as awesome as she is - using words like lame-o  suck wuss  ...well, you get the idea. This may be mildly amusing the first time around, but it gets old fast and it's not exactly kind to those who may really be struggling. I have to confess that I question a writer who continually references her own life choices and personal career success as a model that the rest of us should follow. There is an exhibitionistic, narcissistic, look at me, look at how successful I am dimension running through this book that is self-indulgent while lacking insight about what success could mean or look like for another person.  Read this book for a quick shot of motivation if that's what you need, it's good for that, but look elsewhere for help in developing your own ideas and values about  success and purpose. This is the Jen Sincero version and it may not apply to you." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Perfect Couple" review="Upon reading the book blurb for this one, I knew I just had to pre-order it – a beautiful island wedding where the guests are all staying at the same location, and the maid of honour is found dead – sold! And did it live up to my expectations – yes, yes, yes! I knew going in that it was going to be tamer than my usual crime read, leaning more towards contemporary drama, which it was, but I have to say it was a nice change of pace for me, and I really enjoyed it. The mystery plot, which I worried might be too obvious, wasn’t, and even when I thought I had worked it out, turns out I was wrong.There’s a lot of glamour and glitz, talk of décor, scenery, parties, outings, heaps of descriptions of food and drink (which all sounded delicious by the way) but again that was a given before I even opened the book, and was told in such an interesting, insightful way, that I even relished those parts. Nantucket Island sure does sound like a gorgeous place, and the author definitely did it justice.The story opens with the Chief of Police receiving a phone call that the maid of honour has been found floating in the ocean, on the morning of the wedding day, and covers the subsequent investigation that follows. There are also multiple flashbacks to the day before the wedding, as well as the two years leading up to the event. At times the story is pretty heartbreaking and tragic, so keep those tissues handy, but there’s also some amusing and touching moments that have you smiling.After perusing Elin Hilderbrand’s other books, it looks like this is the authors first mystery novel, and I’m keeping my fingers crossed she writes more in this vein, as she did an amazing job. Even though it’s winter here, and I read under the covers with the electric blanket, this would make an excellent summer beach read, as it’s easy to read, and follow." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It’s the perfect beach day read, or a night in. I read it in one sitting and laughed out loud. The return of Emily after a few years of marriage and a lot of growing up is delightful. And the bits where Miranda Priestly returns are actually a riot. Add 2 best friends, one very monstrous husband and mix them with the Über wealthy Connecticut mommy competitiveness and you've got a jewel of a book. My only negative...I read it so quickly and now I have to wait till the next book from Lauren." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fahrenheit 451" review="In a future society, books are forbidden and firemen responsible for burning the remaining titles. That's the job of one Guy Montag, but he begins to question his role as he gets in contact with a teenager who reads secretly. And he becomes himself a criminal reader of smuggled books.The most surprising thing about Fahrenheit 451 is that it's premise could, in the hands of a lesser writer, easily turn a condescending little lesson about the importance of reading books. But like any work of art that would be missed if it was burned, Fahrenheit 451 doesn't want to give you answers. The book wants you to ask questions.The main point for me is not that books are burned. That is only the most dramatic side of something bigger: that society allows them to be burned, and that no one is interested in reading in the first place. The only sources of distraction for the denizens of Fahrenheit 451 are sports or soap operas in televisions the size of entire walls. The speed of television does not allow you to stop and think, just swallow that entertainment loaf. From this insipid entertainment are born people who literally talk to the walls and a society unable to question.Montag's wife, Mildred is one example. She can't talk about anything other than the soaps or what threatens her financial security. She is a cattle-person, described as having an invisible cataract behind her pupils, afraid of anything different, incapable of thinking or feeling without directions from the TV or authorities. Montag discovers how they can't connect to one another because in the end they don't know their own history. And without that knowledge you can't even know who you are, or what you want.Today is 2015, and the society described in Fahrenheit 451 seems even more palpable than when the book was written in 1953. The internet shortens our attention span towards shorter and simpler texts and videos. More than ever we more intelligent - we have access to an ocean of information literally at our finger tips - but we are not wise. We don't know what to do with our information.And we have no memory. The social media timelines dictate the discussion of the day, what funny video is trending, what news we should be disgusted with, what meme will be the big joke for a day or two before it is once again forgotten. Fahrenheit 451 even reminds us of the mass society judgments that lead to self-censorship.I believe reading is fundamentally important for wisdom, more than any other art form. Reading is solitary work. It demands silence, and to let your ideas absorb the author's, contest them, accept or adapt. Fahrenheit 451 says that you can't make others think, but I believe it comes with a good recipe for wisdom: Number one, like I said, is quality of information. Number two: time to digest. And number three: the right  to conduct your actions based on what we learn from the two previous items." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

The ISBN is listed as 9781514202999. Apparently it's some type of self-published or bootleg edition of the book. The problem is that that version of the book has a tiny font and no page numbers, so for students needing citation information the book's pretty much useless. Amazon pulled the link to that edition, and won't let me return it, but I wanted to post a heads-up on this to save you the trouble of having to buy two copies of the same book!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Educated: A Memoir" review="I was enthralled and moved by this powerful memoir.  The author grew up in a survivalist family in Idaho, the youngest child.  She was not homeschooled---instead, she simply didn't go to school at all, due to her father's mistrust of public schools.  Her family didn't believe in modern medicine.  Instead, her mother was an herbalist and midwife.  Her father owned a junkyard.  Her childhood is affected over and over by serious injuries of family members, injuries which are not treated.As Tara gets into her preteen and teen years, one older brother in particular starts tormenting her, and the tormenting rises to the level of hugely severe abuse.  In part in response to this, she decides to go to college, and by pretty much sheer force of will, does well enough on the ACT to get into Brigham Young University.  From there, she starts a storied college career and eventually gets a doctorate from Cambridge.  However, each time she is drawn back to the her family, her brother's abuse continues, and the family denial turns more and more severe.  The memoir becomes a story of her internal struggle---to believe her own version of her life and to have the strength to break away from her past.I've struggled with some issues of my own in remembering the past differently than others, and I well know the feeling that the author has over and over.  One line, reality becomes fluid, hit me very hard.  When you know something happened a certain way, but others can't accept that reality and attempt to change the past by denying it---Tara Westover is able to write about this so powerfully I was crying at points.I hope this book gets wide readership.  It's an amazing glimpse into a way of life that most of us will never know, and an inspiring story of one woman's ability to change her future." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="First 100 Words" review="First 100 Words by Roger Priddy was bought as a gift for my sons’s first birthday and it is the perfect book for a one year old. It is quite a basic book and the sort of board book most children will have at some stage in their life. It definitely deserves mention, as my son chooses it from his library nearly every day.Previous reviews have indicated some confusion over the book size. This version of the book is pretty small (it's 5 x 6 inches; an over-sized ABC/colors version can be found here), and it can withstand rough little hands as it is a board book.Each brightly colored page shows various photographs alongside the corresponding word. I like that it uses photographs instead of illustrations (animals wearing clothes, etc.). The pages are split into themes of things your LO will probably recognize from everyday life, such as clothes, food, things that go and so on.My son has had this book for a couple of months now and it’s been a huge hit with him. He will sit on the floor and look through it himself. Together, we look at the pages and I point to each picture and say the word. I’ve started him with some Tiny Tutor videos to supplement our lessons while I do chores around the house. We do this most days and the repetition seems to be paying off, as he seems to recognize a new thing in the book every day.Although rather basic on the face of it, I am really delighted with this book and wish we’d had it sooner. It is selling for under $5 on Amazon which I think is a real bargain. I’ve noticed there are some similar titles, such as First 100 Animals and First 100 Numbers Colors Shapes. I will be looking to purchase these in the future too. It seems the simple things really are the best sometimes.Highly recommended!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking" review="I believe this book saved my life.  I'm not prone to melodrama, or to such excessively long reviews, but this is true, and so important to me, I have to say it.  I've been working for years in an extremely busy law office.  It's been growing harder and harder throughout the years for me to handle this job.  Two months ago my boss fired my coworker, and I've since had to take on two people's work plus train multiple new people (as the first two didn't stay), all with constant, all day long interruptions, high-intensity demands, and a high level of multitasking.  This has happened many times before, and while it was dreadful, I managed, but for some reason this time I just couldn't handle it.  My entire life has been on hold since this started, I get home from work too exhausted to do anything except veg out for a couple hours and go to bed, and even weekends aren't much better.  I was taking terrible care of myself and my life was falling apart.  I did, in fact, feel like I was killing myself with this lifestyle, but I simply did not have the energy to fix any of it, or for that matter have any idea how to fix it.I blamed myself - there must be something `wrong with me' because I can't handle the job.  I wanted to leave, but thought, if I can't handle this job, how am I going to handle a new job?  It'll probably be more of the same.  I thought I was just getting soft because I was getting older (I'm in my late 40s).I've always known I was introverted, but I didn't realize just what all that entailed - I thought it mostly meant `shy' or that I didn't like social settings.This book taught me more about myself than I've ever known.  It read like my biography.  Almost every page had a new insight into why I think and feel the way I do.  Throughout the book I saw my very own self described in new and empowering ways.I learned that the job situation I'm currently in - the non-stop deadline demands, interruptions, never being able to work quietly or alone no matter how difficult a project was, phones ringing incessantly, people in my face all day long, etc. - especially when it's work that I actually don't care anything about personally - those are the exact circumstances that trip every one of a strong introvert's triggers. And I was subjecting myself to it 40 hours a week, for months.It's no wonder I was so miserable and completely exhausted all the time.  And as enlightening as it was to learn how many of the traits I've beat myself up for over the years are just a product of my introverted temperament (being highly sensitive, shutting down when subjected to stimulation overload, preferring to think a thing through before I speak - something I never get to do at work, as if it takes me more than 5 seconds to say something, I get interrupted and cut off), the most important thing I got from this book is that it's okay to be myself, it's okay to feel the way I do.  There is not something `wrong with me' that I have to `fix.'  I am not weak or a failure because I don't feel or behave like my extremely extroverted boss (who thrives in high-energy crisis mode, and is bored unless he's doing 10 things at once - and expects the rest of us to keep up).And far from it being an age-related `going soft,' what's probably in fact going on is that as I get older, it is becoming increasingly vital to me to be truer to myself.I also found the information on the history of the rise of the Culture of Personality completely fascinating, it really gave me a new insight as to just exactly how we 'grew' this tendency to value extroversion over introversion.  It makes so much more sense now.This book gave me the courage I needed to start taking the steps to fix my work situation.  Not only the courage, but the `permission' and the understanding - because I now know there isn't something wrong with me, but instead this is what I need to do to be my best self, and stop killing myself with stress.  That I probably can find a place of value in the world by being myself, not trying to force myself to be something I'm not.  I know I will meet resistance from my boss (I'd love for him to read this book, but unfortunately I know he won't), and I know I won't instantly fix everything in one day, and that I'll probably always need to be able to stretch myself a bit to do things that are not ideal for me ... but this book taught me that there are ways to make that work, too, if you understand and honor the need for recharging around such tasks, instead of trying to force yourself to do them 8 hours a day with no break.  It doesn't have to be all or nothing, in either direction.  Basically, I'm not out of the woods yet, but I now see the path out, and I have hope.I think every introvert should read this book, because it will help you understand why you are who you are, and why that's a beautiful thing, not a character flaw.  And I think everyone who knows an introvert should read this book, and quit trying to fix us.Which means pretty much the entire country (or world) should read this book.  The wealth of information and insights in this book cannot be overstated - especially if you are an introverted type of person who has always felt there was something not quite right about you, or that you somehow needed to change to fit in or succeed. This book will give you back yourself, and in my case, my life.  Thank you, Susan Cain, from the bottom of my heart (which is finally beating at a more normal speed because I'm not panicked about going to work for the first time in months).Edited 11-13-14:  It worked!  I'm now working half-days at the office and half-days at home, and in a few weeks will transition to working from home full time.  I never imagined that could happen.  It's amazing what becomes possible when you finally realize you deserve what you already knew you needed." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I found it incredibly dull and tedious and finally gave up halfway through.A few weeks ago I took my mother to a dental appointment and opened my Kindle to see what I had available while I waited.  I decided to give this book another try and started from the beginning, as I couldn't remember anything from what I read previously.  I'm not sure what was different this time around, but I was completely engrossed and my 2 hour wait flew by!  I continued to read whenever I found a chance and finished it within a few days.  I now find myself constantly thinking of the story and relating it to my own life, as well as my friends and family.It's a short and very simple story, but definitely worth reading!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Sometime later I was able to hear Bob speak at a student leadership conference and I was just in awe of him.Why do I find Bob Goff so fascinating? Because he lives life with such passion and zeal. His love seems so authentic. He is not just putting words on the page or speaking goodwill to the masses. He is capturing life at its fullest and throwing it back to us.I am very cynical person. I typically view Christian authors as opportunistic over authentic, but with Bob, I see genuine love for all.Everybody, Always is a perfect follow up to Love Does. The book is full of amazing stories and beautiful calls for action. This book is a great challenge for a guy like me, who can become numb and disillusioned with the world.I highly recommend this work to everyone. And, of course, here are some amazing quotes:“Love isn’t something we fall into; love is someone we become.”“Loving people means caring without an agenda.”“What a shame it would be if we were waiting for God to say something while He’s been waiting on us to do something.”“Most of us don’t need more instructions; we simply need someone who believes in us.”“We don’t need to be the hero in everyone’s story. Jesus already landed that part.”“Grace never seems fair until you need some.”" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Mom - this is the exact book my librarian recommended to me just yesterday! (So, I get mom points for being in the know.)  She started reading it before bed.  At two in the morning I woke to lights on.  She hadn't stopped reading!  We talked this morning about it and her favorite word to use was WOW.  She is in love with the heroine (a young girl) who fights for her beliefs without fear.  When I told my kiddo that she might want to think about how this story is somewhat of an analogy to race relations in America her eyes went wide (and I got another wow).  Mom, that's true! Ok - now I have to go finish it this morning.....Thank you Tomi for bringing a story to my family that has so many levels:  strong female characters, a worthy struggle, and a clear method of analogy to discuss the difficulties of race in our country." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Genius Foods: Become Smarter, Happier, and More Productive While Protecting Your Brain for Life" review="First of all, I highly recommend this book!  It is definitely now on the top of my required reading list for my nutrition clients as an easy to understand, comprehensive, educational source of information.Max's writing style is personable and relevant, with a nice sprinkling of modern cultural references just for fun.  This work contains clear, concise, applicable and well sourced nutritional concepts that challenge not just the status quo and the (not so well researched) government dietary standards, but also highlights new information that could shift some recommendations made by nutritionists and other health professionals.One of my favorite things about Max's work, which is strongly represented in this book, is his unique ability to take current scientific research, process it, assimilate it, and then give it to us in a truly comprehensive way, without dumbing it down.  You will walk away from this book with practical, usable information to immediately apply to your diet, and a strong desire to share it with everyone important in your life.It is a great read for both the person who has very little knowledge of food and the body, AND for the well educated nutritional professional.Some of my favorite highlights include:Field Notes at the end of each chapter break down weighty concepts into bite-sized tweetable/quotable/memorable nuggets.The genius foods highlighted throughout the book list specific superfoods that quite literally feed your brain.FAQ's at the end of some sections immediately address real life questions that come up after concepts are presented.  It brings it back home after a challenging idea is shared.Doctor's Notes- the book was coauthored by a functional MD who adds the medical perspective in applicable snippets.Bioindividuality- the authors are careful to recognize that for every trend there are outliers that don't fit, whether for genetic or environmental reasons.  There is still no such thing as a one size fits all food model and I appreciate that this was addressed.  With that awareness though, I truly believe that by applying the concepts covered in this book, almost anyone will see improvements in their overall health." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Very Hungry Caterpillar" review="Even though we built quite a collection of children's books during the seven years I spent babysitting our three grandsons, it's always a delight to discover another to add.  This one brought back memories of carefree summer days as a child, how exciting it was to find a caterpillar outside, to feel that little tickley sensation as it would move up my arm, and being amazed when my mother told me it would one day become a butterfly!  I'm so pleased with this little board book that uses the life stages of a butterfly - from egg to caterpillar to cocoon to butterfly - to teach counting, colors, days of the week, foods (not to mention a recipe for a stomach ache!) - very sturdily constructed, brightly illustrated, and at 7 x 5 and a hair less than an inch thick, it'll fit perfectly into the chubby little hands of our two year old little guy on his birthday!The different sized pages in the middle of the book (after the caterpillar pops out of his egg on Sunday morning) showing different foods with holes punched in the centers to indicate where he's nibbled through them are darling - each page is thick enough that I think I'm going to cut a caterpillar-sized piece of green pipecleaner to give him so he can watch his very own caterpillar making its way through the one red apple he eats on Monday, two green pears on Tuesday, three purple plums on Wednesday, four red strawberries on Thursday, five bright orange oranges on Friday, and then the variety of multi-colored foods (probably not a caterpillar's scientifically accurate diet, but fun!) he eats on Saturday that leads to his stomache ache - chocolate cake, ice cream cone, pickle, Swiss cheese, salami, lollipop, cherry pie, sausage, cupcake and watermelon - goodness gracious!On Sunday, he limits himself to one green leaf, builds his small house, called a cocoon, around himself, stays in there for over two weeks before he emerges as a multi-colored butterfly, whose wingspan takes up the final two pages!  Though we probably won't expect our grandson to comprehend the scientific term of metamorphosis, he'll certainly grasp that the caterpillar's transformation is magical - a pretty good description of the book itself!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I discovered Ketogenic Dieting in mid February of this year. I spent more than two weeks watching between 20 and 25 hours on youtube about this subject, and read many articles both pro, and con.Why all the research? I'm 64 years old and was pretty terrified at the prospect of eating this way. I also don't have a gallbladder to assist in fat assimilation.  With cancer, diabetes, heart attacks and strokes on both sides of my family, I really didn't want to make any mistakes.In the 19 years I've been a member of Amazon, I've never once “Pre-ordered” anything, with the exception of this book. What sold me on this book was watching and listening to several dozen of Leanne's youtube video's and podcast postings. I found all of her information to be extremely well researched, and she consistently provided far more useful and important health information, of a higher value, than even most of the medical doctors who've posted on the same subjects. I decided to give it a shot, but still with some reluctance, as eating this way is totally counter intuitive to the way I've eaten for the last 40 years.Leanne has a funny sense of humor in both her video's and in her writing style. She's as delightful to read as she is to watch. I have followed her instructions for the last 6 weeks or so, and have effortlessly lost over 30 pounds. I have felt fully supported by her advice, including her suggestion of taking Ox Bile and Essential Enzymes to help with fat digestion, for those of us without a gallbladder. I haven't felt this great in many years, and will continue to eat this way from now on.If you're on a limited income as I am, and can only afford to purchase one or two books on this subject, drop this book in your cart. I have no doubt that you'll be very glad you did. Thank you, and thank you Leanne. This is truly a wonderful and life changing book.Updated - 3/1/18Before I get going and because of a comment posted below, I need to say that I have no connection with the publisher of this book. I don't know Leanne, any of her friends or anyone connected with the publishing of this book, The book was not given to me so I'd give it a nice review. I purchased it.In the comment section below, M.Kent suggested an update. When I went on this diet I was 6'4'' and was pushing 265 lbs. I wasn't hugely fat, just what people referred to as “really frigging large.” With the exception of my ex-mother-in-law who once told me, “Oh my God, you're enormous.” Sigh.I'm still 6'4'' (of course) but I weigh 225 lbs. I went on this diet not just lose weight, but to avoid some of the above stated illnesses that my family has experienced, mostly from a lack of solid health and nutritional information. God bless the internet.I will continue to eat this way because I feel and look healthier. I also noticed a reduction in the inflammation from the osteoarthritis in my spine. I don't eat sugar or sweets of any kind, and keep my carbs below 20 or 25 grams a day. I don't drive myself crazy anymore tracking macros or compulsively counting calories. Between protein and fat, getting enough fat was more of a challenge for me. I eat lots of Kerry Gold butter, Coconut oil, heavy cream, olive oil and lots of avocados. I occasionally use MCT oil.I plan to take my weight down to about 210 lbs by June or July. I've also integrated intermittent fasting into the mix. I eat during a four hour “eating window.” and have started doing a 72 hour fast once every three months. Leanne addresses fasting in her book.Being seriously committed to this type of eating, I've found it helpful to have a ketone blood tester to check on where I'm at, at different points. The breath and urine testers are a waste of money if you want accurate testing. The tester I found, and believe is the most accurate and least expensive is called Keto Mojo. It tests both ketones and glucose and if you purchase it from them, you're guaranteed to be able to purchase ketone test strips for only .99 cents, instead of the $2.00 to $7.00 each, as I've seen them listed for on the internet.Here are some other things I've found useful, on what first seemed like an odd journey of eating fat to be healthy.Greater Goods Nourish Digital Kitchen Food Scale. Great scale for the price, considering all it does. Available on Amazon. https://www.amazon.com/Greater-Goods-Nourish-Portions-Nutritional/dp/B00O5U4NDQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1518967663&sr;=8-3&keywords;=Greater+Goods+Nourish+Digital+Kitchen+Food+ScaleNuton MCT Oil which is both C10 and C8. I also sometimes use a C8  MCT Oil which is 99.6% C8 and is a  bit more expensive. Both available on AmazonI've also found a short mimicking fasting diet, to be very helpful to getting fat adapted within a short period of time, without the hinderence of “keto flu.” One or two avocados and one or two greens drinks a day, launched my blood ketones from 0 to 4.2 mmol/L in only four days.The only other book I purchased, and only for the very serious is, The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living by Stephen Phinney, MD, PhD and Jeff Volek, PhD, RD.Everybody and every body is different and it takes a bit of experimentation to figure out what combination of these techniques (if any) are right for you. Take your time and have a good time with it. I hope this was helpful. I'm sorry it was so long.Best Wishes,Scott" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I bought his because I have a beautiful little boy who has some very specialized challenges, and I loved the message this book sends...that you can be different, you can even not be good at certain things in other people's eyes, but there can still be something beautiful only you can contribute.  And I want my son to know and to hear that message that just like Gerald the Giraffe, he's got a very special dance that he'll be able to do.  And I want him to be able to see that it's possible too, because I know sometimes it can be hard, especially when you're in therapy all the time and therapy is all about what's not going well and what's not going like normal, so I truly think this book has great value especially for kiddos who may struggle to do things the way other people normally do.  It sends a very nice yes you can message, and I love it." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Growing up, the voices of the FOX reporters would be in the background. He would switch to CNN from time to time so I would get a good listen on them. What both channels had in common was that these so-called adults would complain like little kids most of the time. But one stood out that had a very calm attitude, which was Charles Krauthammer. Asking myself how he keeps his composure at such a calm state with all these people I didn't know that he was paralyzed which was a tragic story. Even though I ignored the stuff my dad was watching, if I heard Mr. Krauthammer talk, then I would keep an open ear pretending I wasn't interested.  What got me interested in buying this book was because Mr. Krauthammer had many other interests outside of politics like art, math, music, chess science and sports. The first hour reading the book, I fell in love with it immediately and couldn't put it down. He used a lot of different non-political fields to explain politics and it made so much sense. Some moments even caused me to burst out in laughter. It's not in any way deep reading. The prose is addictive and the chapters are about a two and a half pages so it makes you feel like, okay, one more article and I get some lunch or sleep. But you might end up like me and read for two hours straight without realizing it.  Anyone trying to dip their feet into politics for the first time should add this to your basic reading list. From what everyone else is saying, I'm not the only one who feels this way." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (A Toltec Wisdom Book)" review="I should start off by stating my background. I am an undergrad student of philosophy and linguistics, a branch of the humanities. I also deeply love this series of books because of its obviousness and simplicity. It has personally helped me triumph over many, many challenges. This is why I decided to write a review here.There is a huge tradition of skepticism in linguistics, especially about how language is used in various cultures to create belief systems. A belief system is basically a set of instructions inside your brain based on language. These instructions help you navigate the stressful world around you so you can survive. We are psychologically wired to think our belief systems are accurate and experience deep stress if we find them to be inaccurate.The trouble is, our belief systems are ALWAYS inaccurate. Yes, I used the word always for a reason.Without going deeply into the study of philosophy and linguistics, I will give you an overview here:Philosophy - When you study philosophy, you study belief systems about how the world works and explore important questions like is there a God? or What is consciousness. You may not be surprised to find out that philosophy majors have not come up with answers to these questions because there is always a case where we are going to be wrong or have a counter argument. Much of the study of philosophy is the collection of vocabulary words to describe beliefs. They even have a mathematical component called propositional logic, where one takes sentences and reduces them to symbols and creates proofs but even prop-logic is under fire from academics for its complete inability to predict anything. In other words, it isn't the answer either.Linguistics - When you study words and language, you realize that all our beliefs are based on language and this language can never touch reality in that language is just an arbitrary description of reality, posing as real. I believe Miguel Ruiz must have taken a linguistics course as well--as his first agreement attests to the power of language. The four agreements pulls heavily from Saussure and Derrida. Both Saussure and Derrida (and many, many others) did work on how we form ideas in our heads based on language. The gist is this: we have something called a symbol in our brain which is composed of two parts: the word and the visual representation of the object (look up semiotics for further detail). These symbols are in our mind and work together to form meaning, then belief. The unfortunate thing is that they are entirely made up. It isn't real. Our ideas of it aren't real.If you really want a deeper understanding on how linguistics has saturated our belief systems I recommend reading some of their academic essays or get Rivkin and Ryan's literary theory books. They are excellent and will take you further down the rabbit hole. Most of the essays are dense but worth the effort!To simplify: scientists and academics in the millions have tried and tried and tried to find the true belief for thousands, maybe tens of thousands of years and we have not yet arrived at any truth. Because of domestication, we think other people have it, but they don't! Truth is defined as that which has the most predictive power. So far, mathematics, geometry, and physics has the most predictive power. Our belief systems simply do not.So any beliefs about yourself can be true and they can also be false. We can't know. So why not pick something positive? If no one knows anything, then how can you even know anything?But you don't need to study this yourself. All you have to do is think back to your past self, let's say ten years ago. Did that person have a belief system that you now consider to be faulty? How is that possible? What about your future self? Will that person believe you have a faulty belief system? Probably! How is this possible? How can you be SO WRONG? Is it because you haven't learned? I highly doubt it!But we have to be right! We ARE RIGHT! At least we think we might be . . . maybe?The need to be right is so ingrained within us that we create a huge drama when someone contradicts our beliefs. We end relationships over it! We storm out! We write angry twitter updates.HOW THIS BOOK HAS PERSONALLY HELPED ME:- No one person's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what I can do, even if this person is an authority figure- No one group's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what I can do- No one has a clear idea of who or what I am, not even me!- When people talk, they are telling stories. I don't have to argue. I don't have to fight. I simply have to listen. WOW!- I cannot comprehend another person's dream. I can't mind read. I can't assume. I know nothing of their inner workings.- Even scary, aggressive people are just telling stories.- I no longer have to feel ashamed about who I am or what I've done or where I'm going. It's not my job to assign a story to my life, or a judgment.- I no longer have to pretend to be something or hustle to gain love. I just need to love who is willing to love back. It's so simple.- I take all gurus, religions, indictments and gossip with quite a high level of benevolent skepticism, which allows me to be free from the fear that goes along with these stories.- I don't take myself as seriously as I used to.Probably the most valuable of all . . .- I have a deep compassion for all people. We are all just stuck here together, trying our hardest and doing our best. I don't have to hate someone because their best wasn't up to some story I tell myself. I don't' have to insist they believe in my story. I can just smile and listen and do what I can." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Official SAT Study Guide, 2018 Edition (Official Study Guide for the New Sat)" review="I’m a Harvard grad, SAT/ACT perfect scorer, and professional SAT tutor since 2002.The Official SAT Study Guide, 2018 Edition (currently $16) is the most essential preparation book for the new, revised SAT and PSAT, which began in March 2016 and October 2015, respectively, because it’s the only physical source of official revised SATs—the practice SATs in other third-party books are nothing more than subpar imitations of the real thing.  However, the PDFs of all 8 tests in this book, along with moderately helpful answer explanations, can also be downloaded from the College Board / Khan Academy websites for free (google SAT Practice Tests - The College Board).In addition, there are no score conversion tables provided: you will have to download the “Daily Practice for the New SAT” mobile app for iOS/Android, which allows you to take a picture of your answer sheet on your cell phone, then have it scored automatically, or to visit the College Board website (google Scoring your SAT Practice Test #1) in order to manually convert your raw scores (total number correct on each section) into scaled scores (400-1600 scale, with additional sub-scores).Thus, there is no need to buy this book--it's incomplete, and as I stated earlier, all 8 tests can be easily accessed online.On the other hand, the physical book does still have its advantages over a bunch of PDFs—perhaps most importantly, the tests are already printed out for you (for now, the SAT is still a paper and pencil test, and you are allowed to write on the test, so in the interest of practicing the way you play, you should never attempt to take it on a computer screen).  Those of you who have printers at home know how frustrating and/or expensive it can be to print out a 64-page test (68 if you include the essay portion, and 70 if you include the answer sheets).  Even if you print double-sided, which you should, that’s still 35 pieces of paper and a lot of printer ink.  And if you want the detailed answer explanations, then you’ll have to print out twice as much.  That’s more than 100 pages of printing per test!  Never mind the hassle of trying to keep all those pages organized.  Do you staple them?  Put them in a three-ring binder?  The physical book solves these problems easily, keeps everything ordered and in one place, and obviates the need for internet access, at a fraction of what it might cost to print it out yourself ($16 / 1280 pages total = only 1 cent per page).  Even if you were to only print out the 8 practice tests, then the book would still come out to less than 3 cents per page.  Depending on your personal printing situation, this may or may not be a bargain for you (some of you may be able to print the PDFs for free at your high schools, for example), but you also have to factor in the convenience and organization of the pre-printed book.More about me:  I’m a full-time test prep tutor in San Diego, specializing in SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT.  Since 2002, I have amassed over 15 years and 15,000 hours of full-time teaching and private tutoring experience, both in-person and online via Skype.  I’m also a Harvard grad (class of ’02) with honors and SAT/ACT perfect scorer who continues to take the test 2-3 times a year, so I like to think that I understand the SAT better than nearly anyone.  And I’ve already reviewed all 8 of these new tests with my students, since they've already been available online for several weeks.Many of the one-star, harshly negative reviews of this book will have nothing to do with the quality of the book and practice tests themselves; it's simply that the reviewers had expected 8 different practice SATs from the ones already released on the College Board / Khan Academy websites, and were thus disappointed when they saw the same tests in this book.  (Having worked in this industry for a long while, I was not surprised--it takes a long time to create new tests.)  I don't see this as the College Board trying to rip anyone off; I see it as its providing a free, digital option to students (which, by the way, it had never done before), as well as a more convenient, pre-printed option for less than $20.In addition to the 8 tests, this book contains many additional pages of SAT prep advice, some of which cannot be found anywhere else, along with the practice tests and answer explanations that can be also found online.  Although much of the first part of the book is superfluous, and most of it is also available online through Khan Academy, it does offer some moderately helpful tips in its introduction, including a test structure recap, concept overview, practice questions and explanations, as well as an essay rubric, scoring guidelines, and sample essays.  As I’ve always said, asking the College Board for advice on the SAT is like asking the IRS for tax advice: the writers are not going to be overly forthcoming.  However, I must applaud the College Board for increasing its level of transparency, and for releasing the tests in PDF form to benefit those who cannot afford to buy the book, as well as adding detailed answer explanations (though very often, the explanation provided in the book is not the simplest way to solve the question).Oh, and the College Board *really* wants you to use the free online tools provided by Khan Academy.  I would encourage you to make use of these online tools, practice questions and diagnostics, even though as a professional SAT tutor I am aware of their limitations.Quick tip: when taking practice sections or full tests in this book, don't bother filling in the bubbles--just circle your answers (unless you plan to score your test using the Daily Practice app).  For the essay, I recommend that you rip out the pages from the book--it's hard to write without doing so-- and that you practice using the actual essay space, to get a feel for the proper length.  Always write by hand, unless you are injured or have a disability, and try to avoid the temptation to type it--good typists can type 2-3 times as fast as the average person can write by hand.For some reason there is currently no way to download the Essay Space PDF online (ahem, College Board, please get on this), but if you want to practice filling in the bubbles, then you can google Answer Sheet - New SAT Practice Test.  I recommend that you scan the blank essay space in the book after you rip it out, so you can re-use it later if you end up writing more than 8 practice essays.When it comes time to re-try the questions, I recommend that you either buy a 2nd copy of the book to keep blank, or that you print out a fresh copies using the free PDFs provided by the College Board.  It's what I call a blind review: going over all the questions you got wrong without first checking the correct answer/explanation, or seeing any of your previous work.  In my opinion, blind review is one of the key facets of effective test prep.  Thus, you should only mark your answers as correct or incorrect (this is easier when working with a partner).  Most importantly, don't indicate the correct answers on the test before you get a chance to review them.In contrast, if you go over questions by checking the correct answers right away, then you can fool yourself into thinking that you understand them fully, when in fact you are still prone to those types of mistakes.  The best way to know for sure is to try the questions again, from scratch, *without* the aid of the answer key or the answer explanations.  Only then should you confirm the correct answer and read the explanation provided.Now, let’s talk about the structure of the new test.-Entire Test:  Four answer choices instead of five, no guessing penalty, essay optional (but required by the majority of colleges).  Lots of sub-scores, including not only the usual Reading, Writing and Language, and Math scores (1-40), but also Cross-Test scores in “Analysis in History/Social Studies” and “Analysis in Science” (1-40), and sub-scores in “Command of Evidence,” “Words in Context,” “Expression of Ideas,” “Standard English Conventions,” “Heart of Algebra,” “Problem Solving and Data Analysis, and Passport to Advanced Math (1-15).  I’m not so sure that any of these sub-scores will matter much to colleges: most colleges are simply going to want your Reading, Writing and Math scores, as well as your overall score (now on a 400-1600 point scale).  However, these sub-scores should help you figure out your specific areas of weakness.-Reading Section: 65 minutes, 52 questions.  No more sentence completions or esoteric vocabulary.  Lots of question pairs where the second question in the pair asks for “the choice that provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question.”  For this reason, always glance at the next question for clues as to where the answer might be found.  The new reading section also includes a significant number of vocab-in-context questions, as well as some graphs and charts at the end of the passages, with corresponding questions that are usually relatively easy.-Writing and Language Section: 35 minutes, 44 questions.  For those of you who have taken the ACT, the SAT Writing and Language section is nearly identical to the ACT English section.  No more isolated sentences like the current SAT writing--instead you are given a series of passages with underlined portions to edit.-Math No Calculator Section: 25 minutes, 20 questions.  New concepts such as imaginary numbers (multiplying by the conjugate of the denominator) and synthetic division are tested.  In some cases you must complete the square or use the quadratic equation, and in other instances, you are given physics-type questions that involve conceptual understanding, such as the fact that velocity equals zero when a projectile reaches its highest point.  Estimation is often necessary.  For questions 16-20, you must provide your own response (no multiple choice).-Math With Calculator Section:  55 minutes, 38 questions.  Pretty much the same stuff, except with a calculator.  For questions 31-38, you must provide your own response (no multiple choice).-Essay:  50 minutes, analyzing an argument.  Essays are given three scores from 2-8 in Reading, Analysis and Writing (two different essay readers grade each essay from 1-4 and their scores are added together).  The essay portion is now optional (but most colleges will require it).  The essay space provided is three pages long, not including the page provided for outlining and brainstorming.  The goal of the essay is to analyze how and why the author shapes his/her argument, and its effect on the reader.  If you need help with this, then I would strongly suggest that you read the sample essays on pages 214-220.These days, many students prefer the ACT The Official ACT Prep Guide, 2018 Edition (Book + Bonus Online Content) to the SAT.  But the College Board has been fighting back by inflating SAT percentiles and making other efforts to make the SAT more palatable for students.  For example, one major reason to consider taking the New SAT instead of (or in addition to) the ACT is that the SAT allows you more time per question than does the ACT.  Thus, if time management is a major issue, then the SAT might be a better test for you:SAT Reading = 1.25 minutes per question (75 seconds)ACT Reading = .875 minutes per question (52.5 seconds)SAT Grammar (Writing and Language) = .8 minutes per question (48 seconds)ACT Grammar (English) = .6 minutes per question (36 seconds)SAT Math = 1.4 minutes per question (83 seconds)ACT Math = 1 minute per question (60 seconds)Please keep in mind that this book is not necessarily the best source of SAT strategy.  For that you should consider buying additional strategy guides, and utilizing the help of free online sources such as the aforementioned Khan Academy, as well as Magoosh, Sparknotes, YouTube, and the like.  Or, if you can afford it, then buy some additional SAT strategy books, find a classroom course, or hire a qualified private tutor like me.  Even in this information age, there is still great value in being taught in person (or online via Skype) by a qualified, experienced and full-time professional.As far as test-prep books are concerned, stay away from Kaplan, Princeton and the like—these big-market SAT prep books are typically watered-down to attract the average student, and are neither rigorous nor complete enough for high scorers.  My current favorite authors for serious SAT-prep books are Erica Meltzer for Reading and Writing/Language (The Critical Reader), Nielson Phu (The College Panda) for the Math and Essay sections,  Richard Corn for Math, and Mike McClenathan (PWN the SAT) for Math.  I also think that Ivy Global is doing a solid job, though its books are overpriced.Real SAT questions are of course always better to practice with, but for the new SAT, they are currently in short supply. So you should also try to get your hands on a copy of the October 2016 PSAT (copies were sent to students who took the test), as well as PSAT practice tests #1 and #2, which you can also download from the College Board website. Professional SAT tutors like me will obsessively collect every real SAT or PSAT we can find, and at the moment, there are few of them (14 total), so of course they are especially precious.Over time I plan to write free explanations for every question in this book.  If you have any requests for specific questions, then please email them to me.  And if you're interested in learning more about how to prepare and study for the SAT, then googling SAT Action Plan - McElroy Tutoring would be a good place to start.Thanks for reading my long but hopefully informative review!  If you have any additional questions, then just let me know in the comments section and I’ll be sure to respond ASAP.  As you can probably tell, I'm fairly obsessed with this test and I'll make sure to give you a thoughtful response." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="How to Win Friends & Influence People" review="My Dad gave me a copy of this when I graduated highschool in the 90s but I wasn't ready for it yet, I don't even think I read it to be honest. Now I'm 37 and realizing that I've put my personal growth on the back burner for entirely too long. I had pretty much given up on making new adult friends. I had actually self-diagnosed myself with Asperger's because I was having such a difficult time trying to figure out why people (including myself) do the things that do. The realization that my marriage was being effected by my nearly empty toolbox of social skills promoted me to take personal responsibility and shoulder the blame myself for once instead of blaming everyone around me for everything. I grew up with a hypercritical Mother so I think I had promised myself that I would never be criticized again, even if that meant writing people off the instant I felt like I had made myself vulnerable enough to be hurt by them.  I couldn't find the copy that my dad gave me so I ordered a new one and chapter 1 alone is changing the way I look at EVERYTHING. I've been plagued with mild depression/anxiety for 20 years and I'm realizing that I've developed some unhealthy defense mechanisms to cope with these issues. I never turned to drugs or alcohol, but the fortress-like walls I've constructed to deal with criticism (real or perceived) aren't much better for me. I've re-read and taken notes on the first section of the book several times now and my wife is noticing and she seems quite relieved, i had no idea I could impact another persons life so strongly.  Like I said, I am only getting started with the book and it has already helped me enough to warrant a 5-star rating. This book has stood the test of time for a reason and I can see why now. The strategies are applicable to and helpful in all aspects of my life so far, from my marriage to my job, and even to the way I interact with clerks in gas stations. I've read numerous self help books in the past, seen a therapist for 3 years, been through the gauntlet of antidepressants, etc, and until now I thought I was wasting my time. I've been learning things all along, but I never learned how to actually apply the things I had learned until now. This book speaks my language and if your background sounds even remotely similar I have a feeling that you'll agree." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Outsider: A Novel" review="Either King is getting more comfortable with his ability to draw us in with a minium of words, or he's got a much better editor than he did at the start. I can't quite pinpoint when his verbosity stopped, but it's a welcome change.This is more in the Mr. Mercedes universe than the old Derry/Castle Rock/Things that go bump in the night universe of old.  It starts out being a perplexing murder mystery, and it's not until later in the story that supernatural elements start creeping in. By that time, though, you're so involved in the story that the supernatural elements seem plausible...and then they start making sense.  As the book quotes, Arthur Conan Doyle (via Sherlock Holmes) said Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.  King manages to eliminate the impossible, slowly yet surely.I've started measuring how good I think a mystery/horror book is by how tense I get when I read it.  I was extremely tense reading this one, wondering just what the solution was going to be.I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoyed the Mr. Mercedes trilogy, or 11/22/63." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

By way of background I am a forty-something surgeon and my wife is an author and blogger with MS who has on occasion had to cope with condition-related mood issues.  Without having done much research into the psychedelics other than to ensure they are indeed medically safe (as this book discusses in more detail) a couple years back we participated in several overseas guided ayahuasca (a psychedelic plant mentioned in How to Change Your Mind) sessions.  Our experiences as a couple participating both to obtain hoped-for medical benefits and for, in my case, the betterment of well people to quote Pollan's book have been discussed online and mirror the experiences described by Mr. Pollan and by the numerous academic professionals, researchers, and patients interviewed throughout this journalistic masterpiece.  To describe this further is beyond the scope of my review but we can vouch that this book is one hundred percent serious journalism and that research investment into the study of psychedelics as medications for treatment resistant psychiatric conditions and as spiritual aids for the betterment of humanity is very much needed and is well underway as described in detail in Pollan's book.As for the prosaic the book is over 400 pages and written at an advanced level and will engage the most curious of readers.  The book is organized into six chapters.  The first is a broad introduction to the topic of psychedelics and the second discusses psychedelic mushrooms which possess an  active ingredient that is the topic of many current-era human research studies.  The third chapter discusses the first wave of psychedelic research (I had no idea that in the 1950's these substances were academically studied and thought to hold great promise only for that research to be practically shut down as a result of the political upheaval of the late 60's) and is of great interest to anyone interested in the history of these substances even if one has no interest in their  pharmacological effects.  The fourth discusses the author's own personal experiences as a middle-aged adult with the psychedelics and he is spot-on with his fascinating first person descriptions of the experience.  Finally, chapters five and six discuss current research, expected medical benefits and benefits to the well-person, the neuroscience behind the actual function of psychedelics in the brain, and proposed solutions for safely distributing the psychedelics to persons who could benefit.For many readers this book will change your mind about the loaded term psychedelic and will open you up to at least the possibility the world could be a better place if these substances could be studied with as much zeal as are other pharmaceuticals and could be offered safely for the benefit of the millions of persons worldwide suffering from conditions related to dysfunction of the mind." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Handmaid's Tale" review="I first read The Handmaid's Tale around the time it was published in 1986. I was just 22, a sheltered young thing. I recall wondering what everyone was raving about, since only the top story layer of the book connected for me. Now, with decades of life experience behind me, I see that this is a deeply moving, complex book. I'm so glad I decide to read again just at this moment in time.You would think that something written thirty years ago would seem dated. But that wasn't the case for me. If anything, I think there are so many things imagined in the book which have become more possible today instead of less. In a sense, this is a cautionary tale that a large art of the population ignored or misunderstood.More than ever, we should be reading this and sharing it with the young women in our lives. And discussing it with them, so they see more of the depth than my 22-year-old self did.Margaret Atwood imagined a world where a totalitarian power went into action against foreign zealots and their own people's wanton behavior. This power was meant to make the world better, but it also created a world of highly distinct haves and have nots.She says, “Better never means better for everyone... It always means worse, for some.” It might be just me (although I suspect not) but this sure sounds like what we often hear today on the news and in conversations.Reading this at the end of 2016 after a brutal election cycle, the following quote from Atwood seems both wise and horrible. Have we not been hearing about people who feel invisible?“We were the people who were not in the papers. We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. It gave us more freedom. We lived in the gaps between the storiesAtwood's Republic of Gilead gives people one-dimensional functions. Correction - she gives women one-dimensional functions. They are Wives, Marthas, Handmaids, Aunts, or Unwomen (and a few more which would be spoilers). Unwomen are rebels, likely to be banished to the toxic waste dumps of the colonies. Everyone else plays a part in the singular female focus - procreation. As I read, I wondered what category I'd fall into should I have the bad luck to land in Gilead. The women there have no layers of life or experience. They are expected only to fulfill their narrow role.Why is procreation such a focus? Because of falling birth rates among white people. This book doesn't discuss race except one small spot near the end. It's as if there is only one race in Gilead. And the only people in that race with any power are men.The main character, Offred (literally of Fred named after the Commander she serves) is the perfect blend of weak and strong. She tells us of her past and says, “When we think of the past it's the beautiful things we pick out. We want to believe it was all like that.” But her life is not beautiful. And Atwood straddles the line of past and present, sending back and forth in a way that keeps you wanting more. Just as Offred wants more. Just as we all want more for ourselves and the generations of women coming after us.If you read this book long ago, pick it up again. If you haven't yet read it, move it up to the top of your TBR. Buy it for friends. Buy for your sons and daughters. Use it to teach and to learn what kind of world we could be if we stop valuing the diversity of all people." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

In the opening salvo, he is waiting to be escorted to a literary event, sitting in a hotel lobby, while a woman he is meant to meet is circling the room looking for a woman, mistakenly thinking the author of the book she's read cannot be a man. On the eve of Arthur's fiftieth birthday, his partner of almost ten years has announced his upcoming nuptials, and in order to avoid this nightmare, Arthur has cobbled together a trip around the world accepting an odd congregation of invitations to host, attend, and teach various literary events. With each stop, he goes into his past, revealing more and more about himself and his history. Each experience generates memory, both poignant and absurd. Greer has a fine sense of character and irony, and this surpasses other books I've read by him." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

All I can say is I had never heard of it until my wife got pregnant and I began looking into books for babies/toddlers. This was at the top of my list after researching, and I'm so happy to have purchased it. The art, wording, alternating black and white with color pages, and storyline are wonderful. It engages my son, he loves looking at the bunnies, and it truly is a calming book for everyone before bedtime. This was written over 60 years ago, so it makes you feel a bit like you're in a bygone era. Simplicity, values, family and education are all focused on in this book. We've been reading it weekly for the past 20 months, and will continue to do so for another 40! I highly recommend this book, along with other Margaret Wise Brown books." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="P is for Potty! (Sesame Street) (Lift-the-Flap)" review="My 19 month old daughter now recognizes Elmo and so I thought getting a potty themed book to introduce her to the idea of going to the potty would be great. However, I was disappointed when I got the book because even though it says it is targeted for ages 1-3, it is not well written for that age group. P is for Potty sounds like a board book that would be simple, direct, and to the point, so I was surprised when I opened it up and saw paragraphs. I wish I had seen some previews of the book to realize that it is not a good intro to potty training book for the younger set. My daughter likes looking at the pictures and lifting the flaps, but she cannot sit through reading each page (she becomes impatient to turn the page).The biggest issue I have with this book is that it is too long and there is so much dialogue, making it harder for a child my daughter's age to follow along (There is so much Elmo says .... and Albie says ..... and Elmo's mommy says ....). It may have worked better if the author simply told the story instead of all the talking by different characters. It also doesn't have the word repetition that you find in other toddler board books. I also felt there was something about the vocabulary used in the book that made it more complicated than other books targeted for the 1-3 year old range.In my opinion that storyline is too long and there is too much going on for a 1-3 year old to follow, especially if you want it to be an introduction to potty training (versus a storybook for a child who is at the tail end of potty training and has the occasional accident). Here is the storyline/plot: Elmo and his mom are babysitting Elmo's cousins, Albie and baby Jo Jo. The baby is fussing because he is wet and needs a diaper change. He gets a diaper change while Albie announces twice that he used to wear diapers but is now learning to use the potty. They have lunch and then Elmo uses the big toilet in the bathroom and they show the steps (wiping, flushing, washing hands). Albie doesn't need to use the little potty. They play in the sandbox and then Albie has an accident and changes into dry clothes. He is reassured by Elmo's mom that it is ok. Later, Albie successfully uses the little potty. Then Albie gets picked up by his mom and tells her all about his day.In terms of the quality of the book, the pages are much thinner than the typical board book. As others have mentioned, even though it now has over 30 flaps to lift, they are unrelated to the potty and the storyline, and are really just an added distraction if you are wanting to use this book as an educational tool about potty training. They are great activities for learning before and after (for example, a lamp that is off and then you flip the tab and it is now on or blocks that are stacked up high and you flip the flap and they are knocked over).In conclusion, had I seen a copy of this book before I purchased it (such as a look inside preview that some books have on Amazon), I wouldn't have purchased this for my daughter. I've included some photos of the inside of the pages so that others can take a glance before they decide to purchase." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="To Kill a Mockingbird" review="The setting for this book is the fictional town of Macomb, Alabama in the mid 1930s. The narrator of the story is Jean Louise Scout Finch, a 10 year old tomboy. Her father, Atticus Finch, is a lawyer who is defending a black man accused of raping a white woman. The likelihood of a  black man getting a fair trial in the south in the 1930s is about 1 in a million...optimistically speaking.Scout gets some valuable life lessons from her father. She sees that doing the moral thing, is not always an easy, or popular, or safe thing to do.  But it's the <i>right</i> thing to do. She also learns that everybody deserves to be treated with dignity and to receive justice, no matter what their skin color.I first read TKAM in high school 50 years ago. I re-read it, as I'm sure many others have, in preparation for reading the recently published  To Set a Watchman.  I was touched deeply by this story in 1967. And I'm touched just as deeply in 2017.  Harper Lee made us stare prejudice and injustice in the face, and made us want to aspire to be an Atticus Finch.  A flag-waving 5 stars!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I was drawn fully into the story, set in both the 1930s and present day.  It follows the story of the Foss children in the '30s and Avery Stafford in present day, and brings to light a horrifying and shameful real-life scandal.From the '30s to 1950, a woman named Georgia Tann, who ran the (Memphis) Tennessee Children's Home Society, stole poor children from their families and newborn babies from single mothers and sold them to celebrities, politicians and others who could afford them.  It was all done under the guise of helping orphaned and abandoned children find good homes, but it was actually human trafficking.Avery Stafford finds a puzzling photograph that leads her into an ever more confusing story of secrets and lies inside her upright, respected family.  Along the way, she starts to question the man her family has picked for her to marry and her expected role within the family.  What follows is a heartwarming story of love, betrayal, memories and staying true to your heart.  In addition to the well developed characters and background love story, I liked the realistic view into the 1930s.I really enjoyed this book and learned a lot about a dark time in our history, when being poor was enough to have a family ripped apart forever." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Nightingale: A Novel" review="I very much enjoyed Kristin Hannah character development and story. This book is written better than many books about WWII. The reader experiences the struggles and fear of those living in a Nazi occupied country. I am very, very troubled however. When I read about Isabelle organizing an escape route for airmen whose planes were shot down in France and then escorting them safely to Spain with the assistance of reluctant Basque, I had to stop because I clearly remembered reading this before. I vaguely also remember a black white movie or documentary about this. I searched and found the once read story of the Belgium, Andree de Jongh who actually did what the fictional character Isabelle did in the novel. Much, much, much of the book parallels de Jongh's true story - the description of the heroine; the number of people (118 by de Jongh and 117 by Isabelle) escorted through this escape route: this escape route having a code name (Nightingale in the book and Comet in real life); the description of the airmen's instructions on the train and staying behind the heroine when they walked in German occupied cities; de Jongh's/Isabelle father executed by firing squad; the reaction of the airmen to this female who was going to be the one who to lead them out of France; de Jongh's/Isabelle's invisibility to the Germans because she was just a woman: collaborating with the British to fund the escape of airmen from France; de Jongh's/Isabelle's capture in the Pyrenees by the Nazi's then interrogation and Nazi's disbelief and rejection of the idea that a woman was capable of doing this; and de Jongh's/Isabelle's imprisonment in Ravensbruck women's concentration camp. Why am I troubled? I searched the book, several interviews with the author and Ms. Hannah website and there was no mention of specific name Andree de Jongh. Hannah acknowledged on her website that her search led her to a story of a young Belgian woman who created an escape route out of Nazi occupied France. I strongly believe that the author should have dedicated, credited or acknowledge the name of Andree de Jongh in the book where it was easily visible to the reader. de Jongh is as invisible to the author as she was to the Germans and in a book that celebrated the bravery of women during war. Was Vianne's character based on a brave woman who also deserved bold recognition? This makes me sad." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="There There: A novel" review="When I first saw the title of this book, I read it as soothing words of comfort, but I had it totally wrong.  Taking the famous Gertrude Stein quote There is no there there,  Tommy Orange explains that this seeming indictment of Oakland, California as a featureless hole in the landscape is not what Stein meant.  Further reading of the quote proves she found her hometown unrecognizable as the place of her memory.  The entirety of the United States could be classified as such, given the effects of progress perpetuated on native Americans by colonizers.  Late in the book, the broken promises, actual crimes and genocide are related metaphorically through a story written by one of the characters.And what characters populate these pages.  There are approximately 12 main ones, each embodying a fact of urban Native American identity.  These complex relationships form a patchwork that make the outcome inevitable.  There is search for family, identity and place, many feeling marginalized and invisible in the urban setting they find themselves.  Earlier chapters provide character studies that present the players, their histories and motivations, so clearly the prose flows and pages fly by, followed by an almost cinematic speedup as the climax approaches.Full disclosure - I began this book several days ago employing the audible edition, but found it was too rich and full to continue that way and had to begin all over again with a print version." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Lettering and Modern Calligraphy: A Beginner's Guide: Learn Hand Lettering and Brush Lettering" review="Basically I have the artistic ability of a remote control LOL I have always wanted to learn how to write in a pretty way. I’ve tried official classic calligraphy and that was a nightmare. But then I started seeing a lot of stuff on Instagram and online about hand lettering and a new way of doing calligraphy. So my interest was definitely piqued. After quite a bit of research I found this book online and immediately bought it. I think this book is good for somebody like myself. A beginner with or without artistic talent. I bought myself a “Tombow  beginNer “ Kit with pen, pencil, eraser, etc. I also got myself a notebook that I could practice in. I must say I became particularly motivated after realizing I could do this. While I’m not going to post any images because nobody needs to laugh that hard. LOL I believe with some practice I can be kind of good. I could make pretty envelopes, make signs, etc. etc. goodness knows I will never have a career or 1 million followers on Instagram for my lettering skills, but it’s nice to learn something new and put the creative side of my brain to work. If you want to learn about lettering and hand calligraphy, amp up the way you write/draw your letters, further your skills, etc. this book is quite useful. If you are more advanced you might not get as much out of it. It may be a tad bit of a disappointment if you are definitely advanced/more creative than somebody like me LOL But it would definitely make a good gift for somebody who has shown interest in lettering/calligraphy. I was going to buy the e-book version but for something like this I really like having the book right there in front of me. Plus there is practice space in the book. After I’ve used up that space I go onto my grid styled black-and-white hard covered notebook. I like keeping everything in one notebook so as to watch my progression or regression if I wait too long in between practice sessions. So practice practice practice that’s the only way to make it to Carnegie Hall and that’s the only way to become a lettering guru!This company also puts out other books that are quite awesome" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

So it’s no surprise that I adored “Clock Dance” and want everyone in the world to read it, and ALL of Tyler’s stellar oeuvre.I’m not the only fan who has called Tyler the “Jane Austen of our time”; the comparisons are obvious: beautiful writing, accessibility, colorful characters, perfectly pitched dialogue, and a focus on domestic stories. And woe be to anyone who considers “domestic stories” a lesser literary form, for it is in these stories of quotidian family life, punctuated by human drama, that we most recognize ourselves and develop empathy for others. If you never read a novel about the human condition, how would you learn to appreciate other people’s perspectives?Ok – to the review: “Clock Dance” is about Willa Drake who finally “wakes up” to her life. We first meet Willa in 1967 at age 11, on a day that her mother has “run away from home” yet again. Willa, Dad Melvin, and 6 year old sister Elaine, try to “act normal”. In 1967 you might describe Willa’s mom, Alice, as “tempestuous”, “high strung”, or “mercurial” – today you might diagnose Bi-polar Disorder or Borderline Personality Disorder.The first half of the novel describes the few life-changing moments/decisions in Willa’s life in 1977 and 1997 - short sections, to set the stage and establish Willa’s character. We root for Willa throughout but it’s clear that she is “sleep-walking” through her life. It is in the second half of the novel, set in the present (2017), that Willa makes a bold decision to help a young single mother. That decision becomes the “wake-up Willa, call” and provides her a door to a different future than the path she was on. Will she walk through that door?As in each and every Anne Tyler novel, there is a cast of characters that you will fall in love with and miss after you close the last page. Her characters are what make her novels SO “re-read-able” to me. I never read one just once." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels" review="Our current situation might seem dire, but Jon Meacham doesn’t want us to give up just yet. His message in The Soul of America is that we do certainly have reason to be alarmed, but maybe not too alarmed. The demons we face today we have faced before and, more often than not, we have faced them down.By the “soul” of America, he doesn’t want us to think in terms of a “speculative and gauzy” entity, but rather of “an immanent collection of convictions, dispositions, and sensitivities that shape character and inform conduct…” The soul he presents is not the essence of all things good and noble in America, but a conglomeration of contradictions. “…sometimes the soul’s darker forces win out over the nobler ones.” One on side there is MLK, while on the other there is the KKK. We can’t deny the existence of the latter, but it is the former that we have chosen to celebrate and honor.And so the battle has gone throughout a number of points in our history where we had to choose between the clenched fist of anger or the open arms of acceptance: the Civil War and Reconstruction, women’s suffrage, the rebirth of the KKK in the 1920s, the paranoia of the Red Scare, McCarthyism, and so on.Meacham covers these struggles of the American soul largely through the actions of the presidents in whose administrations they occurred, an effective approach given his extraordinary familiarity with the American presidency. It also had the effect for me of forcing me to adjust my evaluations of various presidents. I found myself admiring Eisenhower a little bit less over his tepid reaction to Joseph McCarthy, but liking Harry Truman a great deal more for some of the key decisions he made.As for our current president, well, Mr. Trump’s style is one of the primary motivations for this book: “I am writing now not because past American presidents have always risen to the occasion but because the incumbent American president so rarely does.”It’s undeniable, of course, that our “incumbent president” has his enthusiastic supporters, but it’s also undeniable that they are outnumbered by those who look upon the current White House with attitudes ranging from concern to downright horror. And for this less-than-enthusiastic majority, Meacham’s work offers a very encouraging and informative dose of good medicine." data-balloon="See users review on this product."
