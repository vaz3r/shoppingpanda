I wanted to write a review to let people know that if you check this film in your luggage, it will be ruined! I noticed that after traveling my pictures would come out this awful green color, I was really upset they weren't turning out and thought it was the camera, nope! If the film goes through any type of X-ray it will ruin it. I highly recommend putting it in your checked luggage and then just politely ask the TSA agents to set it aside." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I heard about this camera through a tech news article and I thought that I would give it a shot. After all, a $30 1080p security camera with some free cloud storage just seemed to good to be true.What I like:Picture quality is very good and setup was easy. Priced very well too!Each camera comes with a metal plate and some sticky tape which allows you to put this on any flat surface. This is nice since the camera has a magnet on the bottom of the stand.Updates come out regularly to fix bugs. Hope that continues for many years to come!The two way audio quality is actually pretty good! Talking to someone is kind of a pain though. Speaking of that...What I don't like:To have your voice protrude through a camera, you have to open the camera on the app and press and hold the mic icon. To hear the other person though, you have to unmute the camera. Seems sensible so far right? Well every time you tap that mic icon, the camera mutes itself again. Kinda pointless to advertise two way audio if the person on the app has to constantly unmute the camera in order to hear the person on the camera trying to talk to them. Not sure why it wont stick to the setting I choose.The recorded alerts are too short. For instance, I have a camera setup in my garage to start recording after it detects sound or motion. Whenever the garage door is opening, I get alerted and the camera starts recording. However, the recording lasts just long enough to see the garage door open and nothing else as recordings are between 9-12 seconds long. There appears to be a cooldown between each alert too. I say this because I don't get another alert in the time it takes me to park the car, close the garage door, get out of the car, and walk across the camera to get into my home. Having a microSD to continuously record everything would circumvent this, but having the ability to have recorded alerts be 30 seconds could avoid this whole issue.You can now setup times as to when the camera will send you alerts, but unfortunately these options are just limited to time of day and do not include day of the week. So if you were hoping to set it up to alert you Monday through Friday between the times of 7am and 4pm, you couldn't. This will always alert you every day of the week between your specified times.This is a small complaint, but the app saves an image of the thumbnail for each camera directly on my phone. I'd prefer the thumbnails to stay on the app itself and not saved in its own folder in my pictures. This also goes for my avatar picture on the app.Summary:This is a fantastic security camera for the money. Most of my problems are software related and (hopefully) will be fixed soon. I look forward to updating my review after they get some more options added and address some of the issues that I mentioned above.Update: 1/3/18Both of my cameras frequently disconnect and require power cycles in order to get them to work. They may work for a few hours or a day if I am lucky. Also alarm notifications are not coming up until I open the app making the alerts almost worthless. I'll wait again for an update, but I'm kinda losing hope here.Update: 2/20/2018They pushed out an update to help fix the frequent disconnects that I was experiencing, but now only one camera seems to work consistently at a time. (This is in regards to live streaming) What happens is I always seem to have one camera fail at random while the other one continues to work fine. As soon as I power cycle the camera that isn't working, the other one goes down in about a day and I cannot connect to it anymore. If I power cycle that one, then other one goes down. This has been going on since my last update and I now only power cycle them if Wyze pushes out an update as it gets old having to power cycle them every other day. I still get notifications on the one that happens to be down, so it's just the live streaming that doesn't work.Speaking of notifications, if you are on an Android device and are not receiving notifications from the app, try disabling any battery optimization settings (i.e. Doze) that are interacting with the app. Disabling that should make the notifications come up again. My phone recently updated to have the Doze feature in Android 8.0 and disabling those settings seems to have made those work again." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

After making the purchase, the product arrived on time and in great condition.  I want to say that I'm a QC manager and have been for many years so it's in my nature to look at, test, move, tweak, twist and try every piece of everything I buy for proper operation and that it works as described/designed.First off, I read a few reviews that a parts list with a very brief description would be nice to accompany this product.  I say the same thing.  You're getting 50 pieces and if you pull them out and count them, you probably aren't going to know if you got all the right pieces or just a handful of the same thing tossed in to complete the package.  I found two straps that I don't know what they would be used for.  I guess trial and error will have to work.The carrying case is made of good quality material with a foam insert, a webbed pouch on the inside, top and the zipper is sewn good.  The items that have elastic work very well.  The head piece has two adjusting buckles and a thin, non-slip surface on the inside that doesn't hurt or catch your hair if not using a hat.  The chest camera holder also has nice elastic with five adjustments on it.  It's easy to put on and make adjustments to the shoulder and midsection straps.  The  chest strap will move some, but that's expected with the types of clothes you wear and your physical appearance.  I'm not an athlete, but it works great and is very comfortable.  The wrist camera holder is soft to the touch.  Has a piece of velco on the inner strap to help get the wrist strap on and then there is a second strap that allows for the strap to tighten.  The camera attachment swivels for any angle and has a button that will lock the camera in place.  Nice feature.  It came with a selfie stick that is about 36+ long with a screw that would screw into the bottom of a regular camera.  The package comes with the adaptor that attaches to your GoPro and the stick.  There is a three leg tripod that works well and can be manipulated to wrap around items that aren't flat, etc.  It too has the attachment that would screw into a camera.  There is also a threaded hole in the handle end of the selfie stick that it can screw onto the tripod to get height on the camera.  There is an attachment that can be attached to handlebars or small diameter tubing.  There are multiple adhesive pieces to attach brackets to hard surfaces.I suggest you check every bolt, nut and attachment to make sure they all work.  All the bolts that came with the product are well made and have the same amount of threads per bolt protruding from the black plastic handle.  I noticed that the nuts that are molded into the different attachments are not all the same depth.  This is going to cause the issue that I'm not happy with and will try to describe what I found because of this.The pieces that have the nuts molded in them and work with the camera and other attachment to get the camera in the angle and position to get the action movies and pictures you're looking for are not all the same depth in the moldings.  Is what happens is when the bolt is placed through the molded piece to screw into the nut, it goes through too far and only allows for 1/2 - 1 thread to secure the piece.  There are two pieces that won't allow for the bolt to catch the threads at all. This is very unacceptable.After working with every bolt and screwing it into every nut, I want to make a finding that will help you, if you purchase this and the company, if they decide to add a parts list and a few operating statements.  I found six pieces that I couldn't get the bolts to screw into.  I tried different bolts and it felt as though the threads were crossed threaded. I finally tried turning the bolts to the left first (like you loosen bolts) until I felt a click.  Then, I turned the bolt to tighten it and those six pieces could be tightened like the rest.  I was thinking seriously about returning this product until I figured that out.  Yes, it takes about 2 seconds longer to get the attachment tightened, but it works and I don't think it warrants returning the item.The items that I do have an issue with and hope the manufacture responds to are the 5 items that will not allow for a secure attachment because the nuts aren't in the molding far enough to catch the threads of the bolts.So, I think this is a good product.  If the manufacturer can get the inconsistencies of the molded nuts fixed so there is a 100% operational satisfaction, I would definitely give this a 5 stars.  Would I recommend this product for purchase, yes, because all the major components work as designed, it was only a few of the smaller pieces that had issues.  There are enough extra pieces in this package that something can be used to get those fabulous pictures and movies you're looking for." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Possible disadvantages are that it works only with the Wyze app as of now.  The Wyze Pan and its fixed counterpart are game changers.  If you don't need a cloud Cam or an outside security cameras these cameras set the bar.  They aren't the best cameras but they are incredible values are as close to zero setup as possible.  Frankly floored by these things.  Buy one to try the worse case is you loose less than $50 and 10 minutes to setup.  If you already have another Wyze camera it will take longer to get out of the box than to get it working.  Great thing for many users. I'm not throwing my other cameras away,  but the other camera makers need to be paying attention." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Unfortunately we didn't notice that the required app had so many permissions, a lot of which were privacy nightmares. Their app requests permission to read your browsing history and bookmarks as well as all the apps you have running on your phone. It can also download whatever it wants whenever it wants. And see your phone calls and logs. After we got this I saw other reviews stating the same thing that were written just after we ordered it. I've seen the company respond but did not like their answers. There is absolutely no reason for this app to need those permissions no matter what they say (and like someone else, I work in IT). I'm always amazed that people blindly install apps without checking permissions, I guess some people just don't care. Which is fine as I understand that it seems like everyone is watching you. But when you have the choice you should choose not to install apps that ask for permissions that obviously aren't needed. (Note: There are a couple more of these reviews that go into greater detail than I did, I urge you to read them before purchasing this item)" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Fuji has decided to stop selling their pack film. I moved on to other instant film and have several instant film cameras. I used impossible film before and it was so so. Never having the best desired results. They have really out done themselves with the new Polaroid originals film!! I can not explain the difference I can only show you. Trust me when I say that this film is worth every dollar. I wish that they would come up with either a recycling program for the batteries or a refill system as it would cut down on cost and price. Seriously outstanding job!!!The Pumpkin Patch is the new film and the other two photos are from the impossible film. The old film always had a weird halo effect to it and colors were never as bright as they are now." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

However, after checking Amazon's rating of the Bushnell, Aurosports, and other competitive brands and reading the product specs of each, I purchased the Aurosports 10x25 Folding Binocs.  Received them two weeks ago  and they are great--extremely lightweight yet unbelievably powerful.  They appear well made and are very easy to use.  I have five other pairs of binoculars of differing powers and the illumination of the Aurosports is the best of the bunch even though some are much more expensive.  I usually don't write product reviews but these binoculars are worthy of my time and efforts.  Forthe money, I don't think they can be beat!Ben H." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Cell phones are OK but in case your battery is low or you forgot your phone, this works great.  I used it for my cousin who had a car accident when visiting and took several photos of her car, the other party's car, the intersection and the general location of the accident.  The insurance company was able to determine from the pictures, that the story from the 'other party about some of the damage to their car, could NOT have happened.  So it saved my cousin from liability and an increase to her insurance premium.  A good, cheap item to keep with you emergency supplies for any quick, visual documentation." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Instead of a photo booth with silly props, I brought back the 90s with this FujiFilm and bought these clothes pin string lights that Amazon also sells. People took pictures and hung/clipped them to the lighted string which made for a great social activity at an event where you have all sorts of people from your life who don't know each other gather in one place :)  just wish this had a memory card, but I won't take a star away for something it never said it had." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Very easy to set up on my Android phone.I can monitor the dog and span the entire room,  not just a section of the room.The best part is being able to talk to the dog. :)I wish I had this 10 years ago when I had toddlers climbing out of cribs.

So I spent some time reviewing the other cameras on Amazon and decided to give it a chance. (It had some other great reviews on some photo sites.)It was delivered the next day and I immediately began testing it out.Key Learnings1. Set up is pretty straight forward. Was up and running in minutes.2. Tried both under water shots and above water shots with the waterproof case. WOW! Great photos and videos. My iPhone is my normal go to camera, but now I am going to be reaching for this guy anytime we are near water! I attached a few shots.3. Love the accessories and the bag. Will be good for taking on trips.4. Mobile App - downloaded the mobile App but had no luck connecting it to my camera. Was bummed that I couldn't get that up and running, but will continue to try soon and will update my review. The App isn't necessary. But it would have been nice if it worked as expected.All in all, this is a great camera. I am recommending it for people looking for an inexpensive and quality camera that will fit in your pocket." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="GoPro HERO5 Black" review="Having been a GoPro user for years, I was very happy to see that the new Hero 5 Black would be waterproof on its own, without the cumbersome external case system.  Happy, that is, until the reality of just how poorly designed the water-resistance feature of the camera really is.15 minutes into my first snorkeling trip on my family's recent trip-of-a-lifetime to Hawaii, the camera inexplicably shut itself down without warning or explanation.  Assuming it was the battery, I got back on the boat, dried it off, replaced the battery and tried again.  Nothing.  Further investigation showed that my brand-spanking-new waterproof to 10 meters GoPro Hero 5 wasn't so waterproof after all.  The inside of the battery compartment was *soaked* and both batteries were ruined as a result.  The camera was used 100% according to the manufacturer's instructions, and all due care was taken when closing and seating doors to make sure the seal was good.  It's just poorly designed.  A quick Google search shows that the Internet is littered with owners having the same kind of trouble.Aside from the obvious disappointment of the camera's failure and its effect on ruining countless photo and video opportunities for me and my family, GoPro's response when I contacted them about the failure has possibly been even worse.  After my initial contact and their requests for photos of the camera, batteries and receipt, it took them FOUR DAYS to get back to me.  When they finally did, they sent a GROUND shipping label for a return from New York to California (a week in transit) and made no mention of the batteries that their defective product also ruined.  They also said nothing about how long I would be without the camera.I responded to that message and have AGAIN not heard back with any additional information.  And I even purchased the GoPro Care package when I purchased the camera!  Rediculous.  My only thought is that they are having such trouble with the waterproofing on their new Hero 5 Black cameras that they are overwhelmed.The bottom line is that if you are planning to use your action camera in the water (as so many of us are), you should spare yourself from the flawed Hero 5 black and, even more, from GoPro's terrible service.  How the once mighty have fallen.  Caveat emptor.---UPDATE---I *finally* received my replacement GoPro Hero 5 Black after two weeks, three follow-up phone calls and promises to send it second-day air so I would have it for my next trip.  Instead, they sent it ground shipping and it arrived the day after I had already left.  I was not surprised.Overall, my disappointment in the failure of the camera remains and my disappointment in GoPro as a company has grown.  Since I have invested in GoPro mounts and accessories, I will continue using this camera until it fails (again), but I will look elsewhere for future action camera needs and will not patronize GoPro in the future.  Moreover, I would recommend *against* any of GoPro's add-ons like GoPro Care or GoPro Plus since the company clearly sees them as nothing more than a revenue enhancement and does not actually follow-through on the coverage." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It does take a bit of experimentation because it doesn't come with a very helpful user guide and some settings are not intuitive. Here are a few things I found out as I used the camera.1. How much recording time does each battery provide? I get approximately 90 minutes of video recording from one battery with a full charge at room temperature. So you can get about 3 hours of recording time from the two included batteries, per outing, without buying additional batteries. They may last a bit longer in warmer temps and shorter if it's cold. Full charge from fully discharged takes a bit over two hours using a wall charger plugged directly into the camera.2. What size microSD memory card do I need? Normal video recording is saved to the micoSD card in 30-minute file increments. Each increment recorded at 1080p FHD takes up approx. 3GB. If you plan to only use two batteries per recording session a 16GB memory card will hold about 2.7 hours of video, which is close to the max. battery life. At 720p/30fps, a 30-minute video segment is about 1.5GB so an 8GB memory card will hold a bit over 5 hours of video, which is more than you can record with two batteries. At 720p/60fps, a 30-minute video segment is about 2GB so an 8GB memory card will about 4 hours of video I transfer videos from the card to my computer after each session to keep the memory card empty for next time.3. Settings: Enter the settings menu by clicking the Down button on the right side of the camera. At the top of the menu screenm you'll see a video camera and a gear. To toggle between them, press the OK button. Use the UP/Down buttons to move through the menu options, then press OK to enter a menu setting. Again, use the UP/Down buttons to move between options, then press OK to select the one you want.In the Settings menu, the Quality setting if for photo quality, not video. The Seamless setting sets the time for each recorded segment in Car mode. If the memory card gets full, the oldest segments will be over-written. For US users, set Light frequency to 60HZ.4. Recording basics: The camera screen will time out after 1, 3, or 5 minutes (set in the Settings menu) if a button is not pressed. Press the OK button on top of the camera to wake the screen back up, then press OK again to start or stop recording. This is important to remember if you have the camera mounted where you can't see the screen, such as when using a helmet mount. The camera will also beep once when recording starts to confirm. I had several times in the beginning where I didn't record because I only pressed OK once after the screen had timed out.The camera will shut off after 1, 3, or 5 minutes (as set in Settings) if you are not recording and have not pressed a button during this time. If this happens,  press the power/mode button on the front for 2 seconds to turn the camera back on.Set a timer on your phone for 90 minutes to remind yourself to change batteries!5. Charging tip: I found that my camera automatically starts to record video when I plug in the USB cable to charge the battery. I have to click the OK button to stop recording. Before I discovered this, I charged the battery overnight, then went out for a bike ride the next day and found that the memory card was already full because the camera recorded while charging until the card ran out of space!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I got one and noticed the edge of the camera was ever so lightly dented, like someone had dropped it. Also, the battery door actually came off in my hand. Worst of all was that about every 4th time I'd turn it on, I'd get a card read error message. This was on a brand new, high speed, newly formatted SD card. I had already updated the firmware on the camera. Eventually I sent the thing back and bought the slightly higher priced standard packaged model, and have had no problems thus far.  So while I like the GoPro Hero5 Black, this E-commerce packaging is a scam, and I'm surprised Amazon allows it without full disclosure." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

This video is my REAL reaction when I realized how AWESOME the light is. The phone holder is perfect and holds the phone very tightly. It also doubles as a desk lamp. I love the many light settings.  I certainly have recommended it to many of my friends and family and I also recommend it to YOU! Look at how it hides all the mama stress on my face! Seriously!!!!

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="GoPro HERO6 Black" review="First I'd like to share that I'm a full time professional photographer and until the Hero6 Black came out, I wouldn't have even considered including a GoPro in my kit as the quality just wasn't there.Now, with low light improvements and the fact that it shoots flat it's honestly a huge benefit to my work! What I mean by shooting flat, is that the video sequences lack the high contrast I've gotten with the GoPro Hero 5 Black edition and that's a GOOD THING! They dynamic range is inproved, less clipping in highlights and more information in the shadows, you can up the contrast in post production and get the look you want. But that's not what I needed this for.I'm a single shooter, meaning that I work alone, even when covering weddings. I have always done mixed media with my Nikon DSLR bodies which meant that I would shift back and forth from stills to video sequences. Now I'm not even going to pretend that the GPH6B is competing with the capabilities of pro-body DSLR cameras, BUT, I can use both at the same time. A recent client asked if I could take stills of things like ring exchanges, the first kiss, bouquet toss etc... AND, include short video grabs of those critical moments? Well, actually, yes, now I can do just that.During wedding ceremonies, I don't use a strobe on top of my camera, I don't want to disturb the sacred moments, nor make myself part of the action up at the altar. The solution is that I can put the GoPro Hero6 ON my Nikon hot-shoe, I set the field of view etc to 1080p Narrow 30 fps.Wherever my camera is pointing to take those special photos, the GoPro is videoing and with the field of view set to narrow, you don't see your 70-200 zoom lens, even with the shade/hood in place.I remain a one-person-show and don't make myself into a spectacle at weddings or performances, AND get both video and stills without switching back and forth from one camera to another. GoPro HERO6 Black is finally for truly Professional workflows. I'm so glad to have it!I did read several reviews before purchasing the Hero6 and noticed many complaints regarding the camera stalling, shutting down, not recording, re-starting etc... Those issues are almost always due to the wrong capacity Micro SD Card. The problem is that they often sell this camera in a bundle that includes a Micro SD Card that does NOT meet the minimum performance requirements of the Hero6When you go to the GoPro site, there is only ONE RECOMMENDED CARD LINE and here it is:  SanDisk Extreme/Extreme Plus/Extreme Pro UHS Video Speed Class 30 (V30) - ≥32GBI personally wouldn't use any card that is not marked Extreme Pro by SanDisk. and I recommend that you don't get a card smaller than 64gb. In 4k, a 32 gig card will get used up in a blink depending on your selected frame rate.Your read/write speeds will save data recording problems from happening. AND, in post-production, you will offload your video data much quicker and time = money. If you don't use the endorsed cards, don't complain, it's the operator, not the gear.I would definitely recommend this camera to enthusiasts and pros that need to add to their image making arsenal. FIVE STARS to say the least." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

But when I need to install a security camera in my house, I found this IP camera device is very easy to install and the quality is much better than expected.  I found this camera and the price is hard to beat.  It connects directly to my smartphone. I can even connect to the camera when not on my wireless network.  I need it for those times when the kids are with a sitter or I just want to check on the our black lab. I like that I can zoom in and out. I can send and receive audio, too. It is very easy to connect it to Wi-Fi.  I would still buy more for other rooms in my house.  Good product." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Upon further research, I realized it's much less expensive to buy the double packs ($13.40 each). If you buy three double packs of film for $13.40 each it's only $40.20 and it's still available on Amazon Prime so shipping is free. That's definitely what I'll be doing next time." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

The wide angle lens is perfect to give your iPhone's video a better look! Usually the video is really cropped/zoomed in, but with the wide-angle and fisheye lenses, it opens up the frame and allows you to actually capture some great shots!The macro lens is way more of a macro than I thought it would be, but I'm able to capture tiny tiny things now.I like that I can easily and quickly swap on a new lens, and that I can use them on the front and the back!Selfies with the wide-angle are so much better!They come with a small sack to keep them in that helps protect them as well as making them harder to lose. Each lens also comes with plastic caps that fit on the front and rear lenses so they won't get scratched in transit." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Bought this for taking pictures in / under the water for a trip to the Philippines and didnt feel like spending hundreds. It certainly has some quirks and a learning curve, but it works great and definitely can't beat the price! Photo quality is great, would give 4 stars for some of the quirks but gets a bonus star for the great price!Some notes:- Takes a little time to figure out how to use it since there aren't many instructions provided. For example, I couldn't figure out how to open the underwater case and I was afraid of breaking it! See my photos here for help on that.- App recommended in provided instructions didn't work for me, but another one called PNJ iCam (iOS) works perfectly. So far I have just downloaded and deleted and taken pictures through the app.- Photos and videos sometimes show up out of order on the app, which can make it hard to figure out which ones you have already downloaded vs. which are new.- WiFi functionality for this is similar to what other things like headsets or speakers use Bluetooth for, but since it connects over WiFi, you will not be connected to other WiFi networks during that time.- When in the underwater casing, it doesn't quite line up so you get a little black on the edge of the frame where the casing blocks the lens. Slight annoyance as you can crop it out of the photos. Need to figure out how to crop my videos." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Once I got all the programming down, I was happy with this camera.  I especially liked the large led screen and the compact size.  It seems very sturdy and the rear mount is convex in shape, when strapping the camera to the tree this allowed the camera to hold a secure position.  There are several settings for picture size/speed and will allow for video.  The night time photos are clear.  The time, date, and temperature stamp is a very nice option as well.  Being able to playback on the camera makes it easier than carrying a laptop out to read card.  I look forward to using it this year scouting our wildlife population." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

True, they are the Duracell brand but they have been placed into plastic clamshell containers.  So I have to wonder how old they are.UPDATE:  Now that I have had these batteries for a few months, I know that they are very old.  I use these in my blood sugar meter, which I only turn on every 3 days to use (per doctor's orders).  These batteries are dead within 3 months.  I have to replace them way too often.True, the price appears to be a bargain.  But replacing them every 90 days severely diminishes that factor." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Most of my reviews tend to be positive. If I love something, I will rave about it. If I like something, I will tell you what I like about it. But when something sucks, I will try to warn you away. That is what I'm trying to do now.I feel less secure having these cameras.The cameras themselves are okay. Not great, just okay.The app that you have to use is junk. I would use a more colorful word to describe it, but there might be children reading this.I bought these cameras to monitor my house. I have been having a problem with a trespasser. I need to get motion alerts and a short video. (The 5 camera stills probably would have been fine if the motion detection actually worked) (More on that later).I need something that stores briefly on the cloud and lets me move the video clips to permanent storage on my phone when necessary.I don't know if it's the fault of the camera or the app, but the motion detection is so bad that out of the 50 to 100 cars that pass by my house every day, it has caught 1 car in the last 2 days. It didn't even catch my wife's car or mine when we went to work, came home, or left to go shopping. This is particularly frustrating because I have one of the cameras set up to watch our cars in the driveway and another set to watch the road in front of my house.I have Despicable Me Stuart Cams by Tend that work far better than the Zmodo cameras.I will be returning these cameras. I just wish I could get back the time I wasted installing them." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

These alarms are perfect for renters and homeowners alike. The alarm is battery operated, so there's no need for expensive installation. Below I've listed my pros and cons of these awesome little alarms.Pros:Small, discreet design.3 settings - off, chime, alarm.Easy to toggle between the three settings.VERY loud chime and alarm settings. (I jumped when the chime went off for the first time.)No-brainer installation. (Stick on)Cheap in price but not in quality!Cons:Depending on how your door/window set up is, it may be difficult to position the alarm at the correct distance for it to work. (I included a picture showing the max distance I could position the two pieces without disrupting the link between them.)The alarm turns off when the two pieces are put back together, which I can't decide if I like or not. On one hand, it's more convenient if the shrill alarm can be quieted quickly, but for security's sake it's not the best deterrent. The alarm is loud enough that even if it's turned off quickly, you'll be alerted that your door or window was opened.Overall, I love these little alarms. I plan to order more and install them all around my house. They are smaller than I anticipated, but I'm pleased with their quality and functionality.As an avid online shopper I rely mostly on reviews while making purchase decisions, if my review was helpful to you, please click the 'Helpful' button below!

Instead of a photo booth with silly props, I brought back the 90s with this FujiFilm and bought these clothes pin string lights that Amazon also sells. People took pictures and hung/clipped them to the lighted string which made for a great social activity at an event where you have all sorts of people from your life who don't know each other gather in one place :)  just wish this had a memory card, but I won't take a star away for something it never said it had." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="GoPro HERO Session" review="After owning GoPro's Hero 2 and Hero 3, the Session (formerly named the Session 4) is a nice break from the usual. You can go to GoPro's website to read the specs (resolutions, etc.) for yourself, I'll just talk about real-world camera usage.The main difference of the Session in GoPro's lineup is the form factor; I found that the smaller, cube-shaped Session made it more versatile for my primary usage, which is to film my mountain biking adventures. It's lighter than the standard Hero, and the shape makes it a lot easier to put in places without being an obstruction (such as below the visor of my helmet without blocking my view) or without being awkward (when mounted to the side of my helmet, the Session's weight doesn't pull my helmet to one side like the standard Hero cameras). part of this is thanks to the Session not requiring an outer housing to make it waterproof, which trims the bulk a lot. Instead I can just use the small mounting frame, and I run the Session naked with the lens exposed with no problem, since it has a removable/replaceable lens (with my Hero 2/3 I had to run the camera inside the bulky case to get waterproofing and protection for the Hero 2/3's non-replaceable lens). The Session mounting frame is compatible with all of the current GoPro style mounts and accessories available.Control-wise, the Session is easy and quick once you have your settings selected beforehand. One button turns the camera on and starts recording, and the same button turns the camera off and stops recording, similar to how Contour action cameras worked. This means less battery drain, no more is it on? questions, and no leaving it on accidentally. There is a small LCD screen to check card space, battery life, and record mode, bit it's nowhere near the battery killer that the add-on LCD backpacks of the Hero 2/3 were. The only other physical control on the Session is a small select button at the bottom if you have to turn on the built-in WiFi (to connect to the GoPro app or GoPro remote) or make small setting changes on the LCD screen.Speaking of settings and adjustments, all of this is done primarily through the Gopro app. Compared to when the app first came out a few years ago, the current version is very good and easy to use. It's easy to pair with your smartphone, and setting the camera up to what you need isn't complicated at all. Once you pair the app to the Session, you get an almost lag-free live video preview to adust camera angles, etc. and every adjustment is a tap or a swipe away.Battery life is rated at about 2 hours continuous, and although I did not actually record continuously for 2 hours straight, I can say that the Session easily outlasted a whole day of recording my rides through the trails of Whistler Bike Park, with enough battery life to spare for reviewing a few video clips through the GoPro app at the dinner table while waiting for my food to arrive. However, bear in mind that the Session has a built-in, non-removable battery. That means that, unlike the regular Hero cameras, once the battery is at 0%, you have to charge it up again before you can continue; you can't just swap in an extra battery like you can with the larger Hero cameras.A few small specifications to address - this Session does not do 4k. If you want 4k, you get the Session 5. You also get voice control, cloud uploading, and video stabilization with the Session 5. You'll also have to spend an extra $100 for the Session 5. Now for some people they need those extra features, but personally I don't. I don't need 4k (I don't have any 4k TV's or other equipment to begin with), I don't really use voice control of any kind, and I don't need to upload my videos to another cloud service. The video stabilization might be a plus, but the videos I've shot with my Session are very good as is - even if I'm riding my mountain bike along a rough trail. Your requirements may vary, but my requirements fit the Session just fine.All in all the Session has become my favorite camera to bring along on adventures (I have the two Hero cameras mentioned earlier as well as a Contour Plus 2). The size of the Session makes it the easy choice, it's super easy to use, and the video is great. The non-removable battery is the only reason why I did not give the camera 5 stars. On a side note, lucky for me I waited a little bit, and I only paid $199 (at first release this Session was $299)." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="GoPro HERO5 Session" review="The GoPro Hero5 Session is a great camera for people who love to go outdoors and want to capture every moment of it in crystal clear 4k resolution.  I bought this product to record my outdoors adventures wherever I go because of four unique details that makes this GoPro one of the best.1. Waterproof CaseThe camera itself is waterproof up to 30ft of water, which means there is no external case needed to take it under water safely.  This is the first generation of GoPros that has that waterproof casing already built in and it worked great.2. 4K ResolutionThe second capability is the 4k resolution allows you to take some of the clearest videos and pictures imaginable.  This also is the first generation of GoPros that captures 4K videos and pictures.  You are not only limited to 4K, you can easily change the setting down to different resolutions if needed.3. Bluetooth CapabilitiesFurthermore, this GoPro connects to your phone and allows you to live stream the video being captured and you can also transport pictures and videos wirelessly to your phone for storage.  This helps save space on the SD card and is an easy way to transport the media captured.4. Easy to OperateThe fourth capability is how easy it is to operate the GoPro.  There are only two buttons on the GoPro that you use to change settings and start recording.  The menus are also set up in a logical and simple order that allows even the amateur users to become experts quickly.  This is also the smaller version of the big GoPro but has all the same capabilities so it saves space and is more compact.I would recommend two things upon purchase of this item, one is the SD card and another is about the many attachments for the GoPro.  Unless the SD comes in a certain bundle, you need to buy the SD card separately which can be inconvenient.  It is important that you buy an SD MINI.  A NORMAL SD CARD WILL NOT FIT.  SD MINI is the only card that will fit for this GoPro.  Finally, it is cheaper to buy the attachments separately on Amazon because it saves money and you can get many attachments which is one of the great things about this product.Overall I recommend this product because of the waterproof case, 4K resolution, Bluetooth capabilities and how easy it is to operate.  Hope you enjoyed this review and it proved helpful." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It used two AAA batteries and it had to be specific brand high quality batteries. The GoPro was a battery hog. It could only support up to 2gb SD cards and it shot in standard quality. It also had a viewfinder because there was no screen on it either. I believe it was about $120-$150 at that time. Not too long after I got the Hero1 they released the Hero2 which shot in HD and I was very bummed that I didn’t wait a bit longer before purchasing.I have since been using high end cameras to shoot videos when I’m on trips, but there are times when I’m at the beach, near water, or doing adventurous stuff that I don’t want to bring my high end cameras with me for fear of breaking them.My brothers have the GoPro black and I have used it a few times and really liked them, but just couldn’t justify their price to get one. Especially since I have had friends that have spent $300 on them just to lose them in the ocean.So I finally invested in an Action camera and ended up getting the Apeman Action Camera for the price point. They have a few other versions that are cheaper, but splurged a bit to get the higher end model. I do a lot of videos when I’m on vacation.At $80 for this action cam it has really impressed me. Maybe because I’ve haven’t had that much experience with action cams, but tech has come a long way since my first GoPro.So here’s what I think is amazing on this camera. I’ve only had it for a few days, but it’s quite a powerful pocket size action cam.Supports up to 64gb micro sd.Can rec 4k videosLoop recording option 3,5,or 10 min. Or you can turn it off. It’s a nice option for me cause I edit and cut my videos a lot.Films in 170 140 110 or 70 degree angels. It can be adjusted. My old gopro gave the fisheye effect and was fixed, but it’s nice that you can adjust it on this model.Motion Detection mode, this was a surprise option to find on this camera. I didn’t expect it. The cam will film once it detects motion, but will stop after 10 seconds if it doesn’t detect motion. So I guess you can use for many options. Maybe film your pet at home and see what they’re doing when you’re not home.Wi-Fi not to surprised about this feature because it’s kind of the standard now with cameras, but it’s available on this cam also.The cam comes with a nice foam padded case and a bunch of accessories. Probably more than I will ever use, but it’s nice that it comes bundled with it.Otherwise for $80 I’m making great use of this camera and I didn’t have to break the bank. If I end up losing this camera I wouldn’t feel terribly at a lost since it is a lot cheaper than GoPro.The test videos I shot with it turned out great, but hopefully I’ll be able to use it soon for it’s intended action cam use.Forgot to mention it has 4x optical zoom, which was a surprise to me.Edit: added some test shot with the camera today." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="GoPro HERO (2018)" review="2 years back I bought a GoPro Session. I didn't like it for a bunch of reasons (no touch screen, no mobile app to sync photos/videos, terrible editing software, issues transferring photos/videos off the camera, no removable battery, hard to add music, confusing super tiny interface for changing settings etc.) And it was $399! So definitely wasn't happy with the experience and didn't buy another GoPro. So then I see GoPro release this new $199 camera, GoPro 2018 and decide to give it a chance. And wow was I pleasantly surprised!! All the things that sucked in that original GoPro Session have been fixed and they even added voice commands that work really smoothly. It's literally like the exact opposite experience! So anyways, I'm not sure if the best option is to buy this one instead of their top of the line GoPro Hero 6 for $200 more but I do know that I am super happy with my purchase and loving the experience. Oh and I signed up for their GoPro Plus $4.99 a month service thing, that has been very useful. Oh and that auto video creating option as the files automatically transfer to the cloud when I plug it in is so cool. I just bought the 32 gb memory stick and that basic selfie/tripod stick thing to start. Ok you get the picture, I would DEFINITELY recommend buying a GoPro!Update: 4/28/18 - ok thought I would update my review since I've now had it for more than 3 weeks.So far everything is working out great! no changes to my review and I will update my review after say another month of using it.Update: 5/19/18 - have had it for about 2 months now and going good. I like to use the 1440 setting instead of the 1080 for video recording, both come out really nice but the 1440 is just so good. It takes up more space on the memory card but well worth it. The only I might do differently is buy a 64 gb card instead of the 32 gb. I might also buy an extra battery. The thing I like so much about this thing is how insanely portable and rugged it yet the video and picture quality is so awesome. In terms of accessories, I'm still good with the basic tripod, it fits nicely in my pocket and is a great holder for it. So yeah still working great. Video and picture quality is great, the interface is super easy to use (on the phone and the app) and it's never not worked and I've been using it almost every other day. Oh and yeah I've used it a lot more in water since my last update. lol it's definitely waterproof without any case. Also it is indeed very sturdy. I've dropped it, my kids have run over it, and it has been tossed all over. It kind of makes it more fun in a weird way. You can just hand it off to your kid and it won't break (and believe me kids break everything) or you can go running around with and not have to be extra careful. Ok I will try and update it in another month or two after so more use but i can thoughtfully say now that the GoPro Hero is well worth it and I have not used their other models like the GoPro Hero 5 or 6, so i can't speak to them. Sorry one last thing and this is meant for parents. Give the GoPro to your kids for the afternoon and say just go off and fill up the memory card with lots of different videos and photos. You will get some of the most precious and genuine moments you can possibly imagine. I don't know if it the portable size or how the tripod makes it look like a mini movie camera, but our daughter came back with heartwarming footage that we will show her years from now when she has her own kids. Ok lol sorry I know most of you don't care about all that, but hopefully I covered the quality part of it.Update: 6/8/18 - ok i don't know if i should keep providing updates or this is useful, but i have some more feedback. As you can read from above, I like to start slow with buying accessories for any device to make sure I am first happy with the device itself. So now that I am happy with the GoPro Hero, I have ventured out and found another useful accessory, besides the basic gopro tripod, that is inexpensive ($19.99). The accessory is basically just a sleeve with a lanyard in three different colors (i got the blue one because well i like the color blue and it looks fun especially in water). On Amazon it's called Accessory Cover Gopro Sleeve plus Lanyard. Honestly though, i pretty much buy everything off of Amazon, but in this case (not sure Amazon likes me saying this part) but I bought this accessory and the tripod off the GoPro site because they give you 20% off if you have the GoPro Plus $4.99 membership. Anyways, it's a just a few bucks, so probably can do it off Amazon to make it easier, especially for returns. Ok enough about that sorry. So the GoPro Sleeve Plus Lanyard is such a basic accessory but man it's super duper useful. Combined with the tripod, it's the only accessories I think I need and they both are cheap (I know people buy the one that hooks to the chest and all but I don't use that). Anyways, it's perfect for when you're in the water because the lanyard can be secure around your neck or wrist. And since fun moments to capture kind of pop unexpectedly, I use it to keep it around my neck so I can quickly turn it on and capture what's happening (especially easy because if you hit tap the record button on stop it just starts recording without having to push anything else). And I know this part is subject, but there's something just fun about having it in the sleeve (especially in blue, but i'm partial to blue), you just look at it and you kind of want to grab it and start shooting something. I just recorded my daughter riding her bike for the first time (without training wheels) and it came out great. Again easy because of the sleeve+lanyard. Also, for traveling, you can pack the GoPro Hero + sleeve & lanyard + tripod literally in your coat pocket. Ok so sorry that was a lot of typing about a $20 accessory that is basically just a sleeve and lanyard, but I just found it super useful and thought I recommend that people first start with the tripod and sleeve+lanyard before spending too much on accessories. Oh and also, if you're wondering if you should buy the high end version instead, i'm not sure what the answer to that is. I am super happy with the quality of the video and pics on the Hero, especially because of the price being $199, but I have seen friends videos and pics off the Hero 6 and I won't lie it's pretty incredible and yeah it's better than the Hero quality, but it's also $399. If this is your first GoPro Hero (like me, well I had the Session like I mentioned earlier, but that one is sort of a different model and as I mentioned I didn't like that one), I would recommend starting with this one. The good thing is they are all the same size, so all the accessories will transfer over if I decide to upgrade in say 2 years. Ok so to finish off, I am still super happy with the GoPro Hero and I've been using it literally daily/every other day since I bought it." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Inside of the box was a very nice carry case wrapped in plastic. The carry case had everything nicely secured inside. The contents of the carry case were:x 2 tri-podsx 4 cross bars (2 extendable, 2 non-extendable)The two tripods have their own snug portions of the carry case that they fit into so they don't rub against each other and scratch up the metal. The cross bars also have their own pouches with velcro to hold them in place and again prevent them from rubbing up against each other.The quality of the the materials is really high. The metal is lightweight but not cheap lightweight. It all feels very sturdy and substantial. The metal is high-gloss black and the plastic connection pieces (such as the extension joints) are matte plastic and also feel high quality.I would definitely recommend this set for anyone who wants to to YouTube videos and needs a green screen type setup or wants to do professional photo shoots.For my purposes, I will be using this to mount an overhead camera to so I can do videos of my paintings from start to finish. The photo I have attached is only using two of the four cross bars, and I only have the stand extended about 1/3 of the way height-wise. This stand can get very huge if you need it to!If you're someone who is concerned about the price, I say buy it once and buy it right. Some of the $80-90 stands I've seen online are not nearly this good-looking or high-quality. Better to spend an extra $40 and have it last for years and years than to save $40 on a cheap stand that will break after a year of use." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Then I started searching and came across this one. It does everything GoPro does and it comes with a ton of attachment, so you don't even need to buy an extra accessories kit. I literally cannot think of anything you can't attach it to. I use it with 64GB card, which works with no problems. It comes with two batteries so you don't need to worry about the power. Also each battery takes a long time to empty.It has a loop recording mode which kind of confused me at the beginning but once I turned that off it was recording forever.Like I said I am using it on a motorcycle in a city with a lot of potholes, and it doesn't seem to be bothered by shock or vibrations so far." data-balloon="See users review on this product."
