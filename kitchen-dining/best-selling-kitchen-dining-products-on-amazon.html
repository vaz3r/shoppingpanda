                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Thermos Funtainer 12 Ounce Bottle" review="My daughter started Kindergarten this fall and being in Texas I wanted something to keep her water cool/cold for school.I guess I had been living under a rock because I had never seen these Funtainer Thermos' before and am so happy I came across them!I was originally going to buy her a Hyrdoflask since mine works so well but came across these just in time...which worked out so much better for her!The fun designs alone are great. She was thrilled to see R2D2 (Any chance there's a BB8 out...or will be out? We would totally but it!). I always handwash it, so it's still in great shape so far.We have only used it for water/ice water so far...so I have no experience with how well it holds up for smoothies and all. I can tell you that when school first started it was 100 degrees outside and it kept ice cold water for around 2 hours (I had left it outside but didn't think to try it any longer). My daughter said by the time she had recess and lunch, she would go to fill it up and the ice was melted...but would still keep her water cool for the bus ride home which was a plus!Now that it is fall, there is still ice in it when she gets home...some melts but she usually refills it with water at least once during her day.We haven't had any problems with leaking but like I mentioned we have only used it for water so I can't speak for other liquids.As I mentioned in the title, I'd order an extra straw just in case...the first day of my daughter taking it to school, she went Cujo and chewed up like half of it...I don't think she ate any pieces (at least we hoped not👀😯) because there were just holes and little flaps of straw dangling off😂😳 I cut off the half that was mauled and just had her use it that way, still works lol but I plan on ordering the replacement pack at some point.I also ordered the hot pink and, like R2D2, I hand wash it and it's in great shape.The lid buttons are still working great and it's the perfect size for my little kindergartener!Also, the price is really not much more than a lot of the plastic bottles, which is nice.Very happy and will buy more in the future!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Hydro Flask Double Wall Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Leak Proof Sports Water Bottle, Wide Mouth with BPA Free Flex Cap" review="Originally, I couldn't justify spending this absurd amount of $ on a water bottle. But I needed a gift for someone who is really tough to buy for, and went with this. Initially he was like oh, gee, um, a water bottle?! But then he spent all day out in 90+ degree weather and came back incredibly enthusiastic, going on & on & on about how amazing it is. So I got another one for my teenager, who needed a water bottle, but doesn't pay much attention to mundane things like this. He, too, went from blah to wow - he literally brings it everywhere, every day, and then refills it & brings it to his room at night (bedside ice water!)So here's the pros:1) Unbelievably effective at holding temperature. Have yet to see an occasion when there is not still ice at the end of the day, no matter how hot it's been: sitting in a hot car, going through a double class of Bikram yoga (4hrs in 105 degree room!)2) Incredibly well made. We have had other metal water bottles; they dent; paint chips or peels. Not this one; my son's still looks brand new after hanging off his backpack, banging around for the past 3 months.3) Doesn't hold odors at all (unlike plastic bottles.)4) Easy to clean (unlike most aluminum bottles.) I can actually get my (size 6.5) hand inside. Even the straw lid (bought separately) is constructed so that it is much easier to clean than, say, a Camelbak.5) Dishwasher safe. Well, I'm not sure the company says that, but I've put it in the dishwasher over & over, and it still looks new.6) Other available lids work well. Straw lid is easy to use, easy to clean, & watertight. Flip top lid is also easy to use & clean, but the company warns that it is not watertight, and it definitely isn't - bottle must be kept upright, or it spills.7) Double wall means no condensation. Doesn't ever get slippery to hold. Won't form a little puddle or make water rings.8) No BPAs (in case, after we've all been using them for years, they decide that HDPE 2 or other plastics aren't safe, after all.)Cons:1) It's a lot of money for a water bottle! (Ok, vacuum bottle - you can put other stuff in, but still...)2) The screw on cap works great, but is not so convenient. So, more money to buy other lids.3) The 40 oz is a little inconvenient to carry. It's just slightly too big to fit in any of our cars' cup holders. (I'm guessing the 18 or 20 oz are the biggest that would fit there.) The 40 oz is also quite tall; it overbalances in pockets made for water bottles (e.g. on all our backpacks. The 32 oz is shorter, so might not have this problem.)4) Since it's opaque, it's a little tricky to fill from a refrigerator water dispenser. Eventually you can gauge how full it is by sound, but it takes a little trial & error.5) Somewhat heavier than a plastic bottle of equivalent size. But it is not a big difference.6) Ok this one is really, really minor, but I can see how it might matter to somebody, sometime... it's kind of loud. That is, if you have ice: when you walk around, you will be accompanied by the sound of the ice clinking against the metal walls. If you're drinking in a library, people will notice ;-)I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants a great water bottle. For many people, it's probably in the category of you don't know what you're missing until you've tried it. OTOH, it's still just a water bottle, or thermos or whatever, and there are lots of cheaper options! This should satisfy anyone who subscribes to the idea of having fewer things, of better quality. For myself, I will buy it again, but in a smaller size so I can carry it more easily.Wow, I've managed to say a lot about a water bottle... If anyone bothers to read this, I hope it helps your purchase decision :-)" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="BlenderBottle Classic Loop Top Shaker Bottle" review="The BlenderBottle is hit and miss, in terms of usage, I have had this product since March 27th, 2015 and have used it every day for the past few months. It is perfect for blends you make at home. I blend at home and after the blend sits for a while the concoction gets thick and settles. However, with the BlenderBottle, I just shake shake shake it up and I have a nice palatable beverage again. Even my girlfriend who has a NutriBullet uses the BlenderBottle because drinking out of the NutriBullet canister leads to the same problem.So I can honestly say the BlenderBottle has made it easier for me to drink and transport my blends and has been the perfect compliment to my commuter lifestyle.SO WHY THE THREE STARS MAN?!Simple, I have had the plastic container for about four months and the lid is cracked. I hand wash this container every day, I never use anything but fridge temperature blends in it and I have never dropped the bottle. It is a manufacturer defect in the lid. The plastic separates from the top of the lid to where it gets screwed on as you can see in my picture and that of other amazon reviewers. I have already submitted a warranty claim for a new lid with BlenderBottle, but I'm sure the process is going to take at least two weeks so I was forced to by another BlenderBottle in the meantime. Hopefully this one lasts longer or is designed better.***Update***I put in for a lid replacement request under the blender bottle warranty which can be found here (http://www.blenderbottle.com/warranty-claim/)The process takes about 15 minutes, you will need to take a couple of pictures and look for numbers on the bottle and on the lid regardless of which part has broken. After submitting my request BlenderBottle mailed out a replacement within about a day so the process is quick. I did this on July 21st and received my replacement on July 27th. In the meantime I had to prime a replacement bottle since I didn't want to go without my blends. Overall I'm satisfied with the warranty process." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="AmazonBasics Stainless Steel Electric Kettle - 1-Liter" review="I bought my first electric kettle almost exactly 2 years ago. It is a plastic Ovente 1.7 liter that still sells for around $13.50. I was thinking recently how much I enjoy having an electric kettle. It's really nice using it in comparison to boiling water on the stove. At the time I ordered, I hadn't had any issue with it. I just wanted a backup because I would prefer not to be without one. I threw my regular coffee maker away years ago and I just use a French press. I'm not much good in the morning until I've had my first cup, so getting up groggy and turning on my kettle, is a ritual every single morning. But as I said, the Ovente hasn't been a bit of trouble...until a few hours before they were to bring out the new Amazon Basics one. The light just stopped working on it. It will still heat but no light. I just find it incredibly odd that my old one didn't act up at all until the very day this was coming. Strange coincidence.But anyway, I feel this is a 5-Star kettle based on value for money. I don't think it's the best kettle on the market in comparison to $50 or $60 kettle. I do think it's a great deal though for $16.50. Even though it's a little smaller at 1 liter, I do consider it an upgrade. I like the stainless steel body and the fact that it has a filter. It also heats up water very fast. The look of it reminds me of the cook in the old cowboy westerns named Cookie and the pot of coffee he'd use to pour everyone a cup around the campfire. Only this one is more high-tech. When I was searching for a new kettle, I noticed some people don't want any plastic parts touching their boiling water. FYI: This does have a plastic part that is exposed to the water. It's the water level insert. I tried to take a picture so you can see. This is not a concern of mine, but thought I'd mention it for the sake of the review. I think next upgrade, I'd like to get a fancier one with a gooseneck spout, but this should do nicely for now. Happy with purchase." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Brita Large 10 Cup Everyday Water Pitcher with Filter - BPA Free - White" review="IMPORTANT info I found from others who posted reviews here: You may have a natural inclination to think the lid is supposed to have the piece that juts out from the body of the lid resting over the spout. Wrong! The piece that juts out actually fits over the handle. Seems counter-intuitive, at least to me and apparently to others who were initially displeased with the lid.Where I live the water tastes pretty good most of the time (at least when the water plant isn't adding more chemicals to fight the effects of algae blooms), but I thought I'd try Brita to see if I could make it taste even better. Result? Very positive. I suspect having the water refrigerated also contributes to the good taste because it's so cold. This is just my first day with Brita, but I've already doubled my usual consumption of water.I had a Brita pitcher many years ago and gave up on it because black pieces of the filter would make their way into the water. I haven't seen any with the current version of the filter. My only complaint is that it's difficult to get the filter properly seated to ensure a good seal. It took me a lot of trial and error to get it in the right place.Update: I've been using the pitcher for quite a while now and have a word of warning: Do not fill the pitcher. In fact, fill it only to the bottom of the handle -- because if you fill it higher, it will leak in your refrigerator. Must be a design flaw because I noticed someone else mentioned leaking in the handle area. It may not seem like you'll have much filtered water if you fill it only to the bottom of the handle, but I find I have enough (so long as I'm filling it a couple of times per day). If I had a family, I'd probably be annoyed that the pitcher can't hold more water without leaking." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="BlenderBottle Classic Loop Top Shaker Bottle, 20-Ounce" review="The little sealing ring inside my old Zyliss shaker bottle finally bit the dust, so I went looking for a new option.  I was overwhelmed with all the choices!I settled on this shorter 20 oz. BlenderBottle mainly because I didn't want a huge one and this one had great reviews.There are positives and negatives with this one as I'm sure there are with most of them.  There's a pretty significant negative that bugs me about mine, though.  The flip-up sealing cap on the drinking spout is so tightly sealed that it's EXTREMELY difficult to open (as in finger-nail breaking and sore fingers difficult).  While, granted, this is perhaps better than it flipping open willy-nilly and spilling, it's frustrating that it clamps on this tightly.  I'm far from a weakling, but I have to work and work at it to pry it open.  Perhaps I just got a dud and this isn't the norm for most of them.  But it's bad enough that I no longer drink from the drinking spout -- instead I twist off the lid and drink from the lip of the bottle as if it were a glass.  It would also be nice if the ounce measurements weren't so faint and hard to see (I actually didn't even realize they were there for weeks).The first time I used it, it leaked.  But that turned out to be user error ( <--Mine!).  I'd screwed the lid on slightly crooked.  Since the lid will *seem* to be screwed on tightly even if it's at a slight angle, I'm careful to make sure that the lid is seated on squarely before tightening.  No leaking as long as I do that!Other than that, it's fine.  It's small enough that it doesn't take up as much space when I pop it in my luggage for travel.  The stainless steel ball does a good job of mixing while shaking.  All three parts do fine in the dishwasher.  There's a handy pop-up loop for carrying or hanging.It comes in lots of nice colors.  I chose the aqua/aqua." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I bought this one rather than the cheaper ones because it's possible to get replacement cups and blades for it and I do lose things, not because I expected it to be strong/faster/better than its competition.There's no point in buying this if you want an all-purpose blender.  The whole reason for this is that it has excellent design for blending shakes/drinks.  It's very cleverly designed to be easy to use and - really important - easy to clean.It's not super powerful.  It doesn't even handle my frozen strawberries well right out of the freezer, and I certainly wouldn't give it normal-sized ice cubes.  (After it failed to fully process the frozen strawberries, I didn't even bother trying ice.)  I also haven't tried it with anything without liquid, so I don't know how it would do for grinding or pureeing.  I would probably use other tools for those purposes.  But for shakes, fresh fruit, half-thawed frozen fruit, and similar things, it does a fine job.If I wanted a great blender, I'd pay 2-3 times as much and get something that was 900 watts instead of 300, sharper blades, and a stronger motor.  But I didn't want to spend 2-3 times as much, and I'm satisfied with what I got for the price.  After reading reviews, I feel fairly confident that I chose the right one in its price range." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have used it ever since, and love it. But this week I saw an instant(?) thermometer on sale at Amazon for $10.99, and I wanted one for travel. So, I took a chance, and got it yesterday. (Pic below- the new one is red). As soon as I got it I wanted to test the speed and accuracy. I tried it, side by side, on some bread just coming out of the oven. They showed the same temp within a second of each other. Tried it again this morning on boiling water for my tea. Exactly the same temp in exactly the same amount of time. I don't know if it will hold up long-term, but I'm really happy !" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

These stainless steel straws have been the answer!To clean, I soaked in vinegar water when they first arrived, and since, I've rinsed immediately after use in very hot water. The package also includes a pipe cleaner-like bristle brush for cleaning inside the straws.I LOVE THESE! I intend to give as gifts to parents of young kids.. They are wonderful and unusual, but useful and a GREAT, functional addition to our household.So many of us rely on Amazon reviews to make purchasing decisions for our families. I hope my review has helped you. Please click the Helpful icon so others can find this quickly!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It is: easy to use; ultra-responsive, fast-working; compact enough for travel; and bundled with 5 super-sharp Blades. This might be their best spiralizer yet!A. GENERAL NOTES:1. Take the spiralizer out of the box. Note that it is small, compact, and easy to store, with the 2 extra Blades held in the plastic Blade Storage Caddy/ container, while 2 other Blades are kept under the unit and a third is in the Blade Rack. Because this unit is small and compact, it would be easy to travel with – fully assembled.2. Wash the unit and all 5 Blades in warm, soapy water to remove industrial manufacturing residue. Then, dry fully before using.3. Note that the unit comes fully assembled to save time in having to match up the different steps on the instruction sheet with graphics.4. * Optional: I flipped over each of the 5 Blades after having arranged them in size from: 2 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm, 5.5 mm, to Flat. I took a permanent/ indelible marker and wrote the sizes on the flat bottom tab that inserts into the Blade Rack. This saves me lots of time in having to match up Blade sizes to the instruction sheet with graphics. You may choose not to do this.5. Some olive oil should be rubbed on the Platform slide and then, the slide tracks should be oiled to eliminate squeaks and to allow constant ease in spiralizing. Reapply when needed.6. For spiralizing, I don’t use the light-green Side Handle because it is more comfortable for me to use my left hand, instead, to hold the Blade plate secured into the Rack. Some people, however, may find that using the side handle is more comfortable for them.7. To more securely grasp the food, always stab/ poke food ends before inserting them into the Holder on one side and the small, round, metal Spindle core on the Blade plate, on the other end.8. Use a large square plate or rectangular baking dish to collect food.9. Brieftons spiralizers typically produce 3-4 foot-long food spirals, which are beautiful to see coming out of the unit, and are great for dinner party guests to see to go ‘ooh and aah’. I take kitchen shears, however, to cut down the lengths, to make them easier to eat. Using these shears is a safe activity that children could do to help out their parents when they spiralize.10. Always peel hard foods like sweet potato, first, to make them faster to spiralize. I use the Brieftons super-sharp Vegetable Peeler (also with Japanese #420 stainless steel blades) when I peel any food. I then toss all peels into our food (as well as cores, etc.).11. Note that there is a Platform slide safety mechanism, which stops this slide slightly before reaching the Rack (with Blade in it), preventing the Platform slide from running into the teeth of the Holder and damaging them; this is one feature that many spiralizers don’t have, and it is an important one to have to save time by not having to think about when to stop working. In essence, the user starts, uses, and stops with ease and speed throughout the entire spiralizing process.12. Blade insertion and removal is a dream – so easy, yet the Blades lock securely into the Blade Rack base on the Body, to protect the user and surrounding people who are nearby, from having unsecured blades pop out and do injury.13. Note that the Blades are super-sharp, so they must be handled with care. As a precaution, the user may want to wear special gloves that are: cut-resistant/ cut-proof, ‘no-cut’, safety (stainless steel) when handling and cutting with sharp objects like knives and blades.14. When the unit is flipped over, there is 1 big rubber Suction Pad on the right side, under the Lock Lever, with a rubberized light-green bumper on the edge under the Rack; both are needed to secure the unit down on the counter/ marble cutting board. Watch my vid and note that this spiralizer (like all Brieftons tabletop units) picks up my 11.25 pound (5 kilo) marble cutting board with ease. This means that the Pad is strong enough to do work. Thus, it is imperative to keep the Suction Pad and the cutting board surface always clean before doing any work.15. When securing the Suction Pad onto the marble board/ non-porous counter, be sure to firmly grasp the unit Lock Lever to be able to have adequate shoulder/ arm strength to push the Lever DOWN to secure the Pad. (Raise your body up slightly off of the ground if you aren’t tall. I rise up on my toes because of the added height of my marble cutting board.) People who are shorter may need to rise up at least 6” from our standard counter height in order to do this. Conversely, the problem can be solved by using a riser/ box of some sort to raise themselves up at least 6”. Note that for this reason (needing adequate shoulder/ arm strength to lock the lever down), it is advisable NOT to do the following: do NOT spiralize at a kitchen table, desk, or even a coffee table; no spiralizer works well this way. Therefore, always stand but at a height in which the shoulders and arms are ABOVE/ OVER the counter – not straight or even slightly lower. (*Note that all tabletop spiralizer brands and models are affected by user height, in order to have the power to spiralize – not just Brieftons models. You will see this in all professional demo spiralizer vids.)16. Cleaning is done by using a small, soft brush to remove food bits from the Blades, the unit Holder, and the Spirilizer Body under running tap water, and then adding dish soap and baking soda all the while brushing and cleaning them under the tap constantly. For foods that stain (sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, etc.), after removing the food bits with the brush and washing with the soap and baking soda, form a paste with these 2 items: let sit 20 minutes, scrub with the brush, and rinse. Repeat at 20 minute intervals if needed until all stains are removed. Doing this seems to temper the plastic to guard against having to do many future paste intervals. (This is a similar process to tempering a wok [maybe redoing it every so often], in order to create a pan that doesn’t stick in the future.)B. COMMON FOODS TO SPIRALIZE with SOME BR-5B-02 BLADE MM NUMBERS TO USE: (Experiment on your own to find other Blade combinations.)1. Onion: FLAT for spirals2. Zucchini/ Calabazza: 2-3 MM for spirals3. Bell Peppers: FLAT for spirals (Note: Use green, red, yellow, orange veg that are square only – not elongated, twisted varieties that don’t spiralize.)4. Russett/ Baking Potato: 3 MM for spirals5. Sweet Potato: 5.5 MM for spirals (peeled beforehand because this is a hard food)6. Carrot: 2 MM for spirals7. Cucumbers: 3 MM for spirals8. Beets: 5 - 5.5 MM for spirals9. Cabbage: FLAT for shreds10. Potato Chips: FLAT11. V-shaped Chips: FLAT (with 2 ditches, pre-cut at 180 degrees apart: see the brieftons.com demo vid/ instruction sheet with graphics)C.

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Balega Hidden Comfort No-Show Running Socks for Men and Women (1 Pair)" review="I have a number of pairs of Balega socks which I've worn for running, and the Soft Tread is my favorite overall. Here's a few comparative thoughts.I've bought five different types of Balega socks in total:Balega Soft Tread No Show (Balega Soft Tread No Show - Royal BAL8926)Balega Ultralight No Show (Balega Ultralight No Show Socks - Royal Blue/White - Small)Balega Hidden Contour (Balega Hidden Contour Socks, Black/Yellow, Large)Balega Hidden Comfort -- THIS PRODUCTBalega Blister Resist No Show (Balega Blister Resist No Show Socks, White, Large)The Balega Ultralight are very thin and rather smaller--especially in comparison to the other models. I've bought size Large in every sock, and they vary quite a bit. (For reference, I normally wear a men's 10, though I wear 11s for running.) If you like thin small socks, you may like the ultralight. Or go a size big if you want them to fit more comfortably.On the other hand, the Blister Resist were way too thick and large. They had so much excess material that they felt horrible and my feet moved around in them. They are very hot. The material on the top of the foot is actually very thin, but the bottom makes up for it. That said, They make a comfortable sock to walk around in on my wood floors in the winter. Since I won't run in them, I give them use around the house.The Hidden Contour and Hidden Comfort are similar. The Hidden Comfort are a tad thicker. They are both a bit thicker and larger than the Soft Tread socks, but they are comfortable and nicer for winter weather, when I tend to wear them running. If I were buying more, I'd go for the Hidden Comfort. Mine have stayed superbly comfortable longer than the Hidden Contour and still feel more padded.I like the Soft Tread best (for running) because they are thick enough to be padded and comfortable, but I have to pull them snug on my feet so there is no room for my feet to move against the sock. Also, they are not so thick that I feel my feet get hot -- and I run in 100 degree Texas summer weather. Finally, the Soft Tread are made R and L foot specific, which I've found to be helpful for fit. The Ultralights are as well, but not the other three models, if I recall correctly. Though the Hidden Comfort came with an L on each sock, that stands for Large, not Left. Also, the heel tabs on a lot of these sock models, including this one, are great and do a lot to make sure the sock stays in place.Hopefully this review helps a few folks decide what Balega sock might be best for them if they're looking to purchase. If you have questions, comment and I'll try to answer them." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Intex Comfort Plush Elevated Dura-Beam Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump, Bed Height 22", Queen" review="Based on many of the reviews, I was hesitant to buy this product. It was either loved or hated. Many claimed it leaked air during the night. But I liked the built in pump and the height off the ground, important for an elderly couple. We have slept on it for two nights so we don't have a long term report to make. But I found as the air mattress engineer of the family I found it compact and I like the storage pouch that came with it for travel or storage. The pump filled the mattress quickly and was easy to adjust the inflation. I filled it at first and then let it settle out. Then once it had stretched out and all chambers filled, I pumped it up to the firm mattress we like for our backs. The first night we did find that it leaked air getting more like a water bed. Not good. But I had myself to blame, not the product. I had not fully read the instructions. The mattress and pump has a knob that changes the direction of the pump. One way for filling and the other way for pump all the air out so that it becomes completely flat for easy folding and storage in the supplied pouch. If that knob is not either all the way one way or the other, it can let some air leak out. But if firmly to the right (clockwise) for filling, then we found the second night that the mattress did not leak at all and stayed fully inflated until I pumped the air out for storage. A standard Queen fitted sheet fits perfectly. At a full inflation, one sleeper did not wake up the other when getting out of bed for a toilet visit during the night. Better than many standard beds. With additional uses, I may well bump the rating up to 5 star if it continues to perform as it seemed to on the two nights we used it." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="ZeroWater ZR Replacement Filters" review="I was purchasing my Zero Water Filters for at least 2 years from Amazon, through Amazon LLC in the big packs being the 8 & the 12.  Not anymore I'm not & will not!!  I was noticing that my Zero Water Filters were going bad very quickly after just 1 month of use which they never used to & would last me 3 to 4 months at least which was awesome & made me really like the quality of Zero Water & the taste.  I could not understand why the Zero Water Filters were going bad on me so fast & neither could my Mom who also had a Zero Water Pitcher & was buying her filters from me that were bought on Amazon.com by Amazon LLC.  We were both experiencing this 1 month only Zero Water Filter Life that seemed odd & very worthless to keep buying them.I was considering throwing away my Zero Water Pitcher & going with another brand of filtered water pitcher.  She was doing research on what brands remove the most contaminants & impurities.  Zero Water was the only one that she’d read that helps the most with removing all the impurities & contaminants from water as compared to all the other brands available out there on the market that don't & can't even come close to what Zero Water does & is capable of.  Therefore, on her own, she decided that she was not going to be like me & change out to another brand of water filtration pitcher.  She decided to stick with Zero Water but instead, order the 8 pack of Zero Water Filters from Walmart.com & pick them up in store.  Thus, that it what she did.  After she got them & opened them up, I noticed & she did too that they were fully filled up to the very top with the charcoal gravel and other stuff that Zero Water puts inside their filters to make the Zero Water as pure as it gets. I still had one of my Zero Water Filters left from Amazon.  Therefore, I decided to compare them & see what might be different.  It turns out that the Zero Water Filters from & sold by Amazon LLC were only filled up 50% inside the filter & with lots of empty air space.  The Zero Water Filters from Walmart & sold directly by Walmart.com were filled up inside at 100% all the way to the top with no air space unlike the ones that I ordered directly from Amazon LLC for my water pitcherShe installed one of the new Zero Water Filters from Walmart that she ordered for herself.  She had me test her water out with the Zero Water PPM Tester just recently after she had one of the new the Zero Water Filters that she ordered from Walmart installed on her water pitcher for 2 months.  The turnout was nice & shockingly unexpected being only 002 PPM after 2 months & counting of having her new Zero Water filter from Walmart installed on her water pitcher & using it 2 times per day.  That right there had just proved & made a point to both of us.  It meant that me & her had been getting screwed & ripped off with cheap possibly recycled & resold knock off Zero Water Filters that Amazon LLC was selling & may still be which, as we both found out only last up to 1 month for as expensive as they are sold by Amazon LLC directly!!  They are not 100% filled up with the water purification ingredients like they should be but instead, only at 50% as compared to the Zero Water Filters sold directly from & by Walmart which are filled up all the way at 100%.  They last 3 times longer than these knock off Zero Water Filters being shipped & sold to Amazon LLC for us to purchase & waste our precious money on!!!  Me & my Mom will no longer ever purchase Zero Water Filters From Amazon again & will continue to purchase them from directly from Walmart.com for the same price but for way better quality as well as way longer lasting Zero Water Filters that don't go bad in just 1 months’ time like the ones sold here directly by Amazon LLC which are surely cheap, recycled, remanufactured knock offs that again are not even filled up all of the way inside & too are and have been soggy & wet inside the plastic packaging when we opened them up to install on our Zero Water Pitchers which to me was always suspicious too.I recommend purchasing these Zero Water Filters directly from Walmart.com instead of Amazon.  Don't waste your money here like I did for 2 years straight on useless, less life Zero Water Filters that aren't any cheaper than Walmart.com & that only last up to 1 month per filter as compared to 3 to 4 times longer lasting better ones sold directly from & by Walmart.com that aren't useless knock offs yet & are the real thing that last way longer unlike the ones being sold to us here by Amazon LLC." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I bought one of the small versions first, the kind you hold in one hand as you use the other hand to twist a vegetable through.  It worked, but it had a couple of frustrating aspects.  I know there was potential so I sprang for this more expensive spiralizer and I'm glad I did.  It truly could not work better.There are a couple of things to be aware of.  Soft vegetables, zucchini, etc., work fine in smaller sizes, but small hard vegetables, carrots, etc., maybe 1.25 diameter, don't work very well.  So for carrots I buy larger than I normally would.  For zucchini, yellow summer squash, etc., small or large both work.  Even oversize vegetables and fruit work fine.Vegetables used as spaghetti substitute don't taste exactly like pasta; instead the flavor comes from the sauce and the vegetable, but somehow a zucchini made into spaghetti strands doesn't taste like zucchini, it tastes much better.  That might be because it's so thin it only has to cook for about two minutes max.  Add some good sauce (I add Field Roast Apple Sage vegetarian sausage) and grated parmesan and you've got a dish that's delicious in its own right - it doesn't need to mimic pasta, although with sauce it comes close.I haven't gotten too far into the salad realm yet, but I've done carrot, cucumber, radish and jicama with a light citrus dressing.  Very good!The spiralizer is bigger than I expected, approximately 14 x 8.5 x 6.  The way the blades are changed is ingenious and means you don't actually handle the blades directly.I'm really glad I bought this and HIGHLY recommend it!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

We just bought a second set of 4, we like them so much. Love our Keurig but shudder at the cost differential to operate (by using pre-packaged K-cups). With these filter cups, we can still buy our regular coffee but have the convenience of a couple cups at a time (versus a whole pot). Slashes the operating cost!PS - If you use very finely ground coffee, I recommend also purchasing the paper filters that go inside these. We opted for the canFly Optional K-cup Coffee Paper Filter for Ekobrew and Keurig Single Serve Filter (300 Count)." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

But the cap was apparently designed to be opened to about 120 degrees. When the cap hits the 90-degree position and stops, continue to gently rotate it. The cap will “click” and then continue to move, coming to rest at a final open position of about 120 degrees. And thanks to that little “click” you feel at 90 degrees, it will lock in that fully open position so the cap doesn’t fall onto your nose if you drink without using a straw.I can’t speak to any other complaints others may have, but the lid's cap should clear your nose just fine if you open it all the way." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I stumbled upon these specific straws when I was shopping for a double-walled tumbler.  They came up as a recommended item and so I decided to look into them.  The reviews seemed positive and you can't beat the price!  So I decided to give them a try.I am so glad I did!  They fit my 30oz tumbler perfectly and I love how easy they are to clean, especially with the included brush.  I would absolutely recommend these straws, especially for the ever popular double-walled tumblers.My only warning would be that if you are using these straws with a iced beverage, your lips may be in for a little shock.  I know it seems like common sense that the metal straw would be cold, but I just wanted to point it out.  It's something to get used to, although I love my drinks super cold, so it didn't take me long to adjust." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Best Ultra Fast Digital Kitchen Probe. Includes Internal BBQ Meat Temperature Guide" review="I bought a number of these, one for me and the rest for Christmas presents. When I first got these, I was a little disappointed because they were a bit bigger then I was expecting and the fast response was clarified in the internal as more like 4 seconds. The vendor had sent me an email asking if I received them and how I liked them. I responded  honestly with the above and said I was contemplating returning them. He replied back almost immediately that if I would try one of them for 30 days and still did not like it, I could return them for a full refund, no questions asked. So I tried it, and yes, I do like it and kept it.I like the fact it automatically turns off when you lock the probe back into the body. It really is faster than the other electronic thermometer that I have and it is a good size to allow testing the meat on a grill without burring your hand. The probe business end is not tiny, but still pretty small and makes very small hole in the meat. So I do like it after all and recommend it to other grillers out there. Plus, with customer service like that, how can you go wrong?" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

This isn't the sort of product you'll need additional pictures or videos about because it's exactly as identified on the product page.  Not fancy, no extra frills, just the old fashioned working as intended design.I generally find shaker balls themselves to be a waste of time, but the ones included do work, I think.  I can't tell the difference between when I shake it with or without the balls, but your mileage may vary and to each their own or whatever other cliche phrase you'd like to substitute.I will say, however, that they do not leak and they do not drip liquid onto your nose like some other bottles do.  The cap has an extended, round, nub that doesn't collect whatever you're shaking, so it will not drip on you when you're done shaking and onto drinking.  I had a bottle that dripped on my nose every time because I *ALWAYS* forgot about it.  It's a nice touch not to be dripped on. I don't think anyone likes being dripped on.These are quality shaker bottles, and the price for the 3 pack is great.  I highly recommend these over the more expensive gimmicky ones.  Much higher value proposition, and unless you MUST have said gimmick or the look of the other shaker bottle is to die for, these are the way to go.  They have my no-drip seal of approval." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="[5-Pack,29oz] Glass Meal Prep Containers - Food Prep Containers with Lids Meal Prep - Food Storage Containers Airtight - Lunch Containers Portion Control Containers - BPA Free Container" review="Switching from plastic to glass is so worth it! No more staining, no more scratching, no more replacing worn plastic containers every year! These are now our go-to containers for leftovers. We usually make enough of our dinner meal to have leftovers for lunch the next day, so the hot meal goes right onto our plates for dinner and into containers for lunch. With our old plastic containers, I'd have to wait to seal the lid, otherwise it would create a vacuum in the fridge as the food cooled. If you've ever had this happen, you know how difficult it is to get that lid off! With these, I can put the lid on immediately and just open the vent. It's such a small feature, but I love it! For reheating food, these are great in the microwave where you can keep the lid on and open the vent to prevent splatters, but they can also go in a toaster oven or a regular oven without the lids. Foods like pizza and breaded chicken taste so much better when reheated in the oven, so this is a big plus over plastic containers. These are also very easy to clean. I put the glass anywhere in the dishwasher, but I usually hand wash the lids. The sealing ring in the lids can also be removed if you need to clean it.My first set of glass containers like this was the Vremi 18 Piece Set (Vremi 18 Piece Glass Food Storage Containers with Locking Lids - BPA Free Airtight Oven Freezer Dishwasher and Microwave Safe Food Container Set - Small and Large Reusable Square Food Containers) which I love! However, I wanted a few more of the larger size so that we could put that day's in the dishwasher and still have containers ready for the next day. What I received is actually a little larger than the description...30 oz and 7.4 x 5.6 x 2.5, but they complement my Vremi set perfectly! The 30 oz Prep Naturals containers are right in-between the two largest Vremi sizes (27 oz. and 35 oz.), so the three nest together. The Prep Naturals containers do not nest with themselves, but I'm very happy that they will nest with my Vremi set. These are the perfect size for leftovers, but they also easily fit a sandwich made on regular-sized slices of bread (if you're more into subs, two of the 6-inch Arnold steak rolls will fit!). Like my Vremi ones, these snap tightly closed, and I haven't had any issues getting all four snaps to lock down. If you do have trouble, try closing opposite sides first. If you close adjacent sides first, it makes it harder to get the other two sides to latch down because of the angle created by the two that are latched. I've also found that applying downward force as you push in makes it easier to latch. I hope that helps!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I did a fair amount of comparison shopping amongst brands and the second choice for me would have been the Inspiralizer. I liked that it did not require storage if all the differing blade plates but rather one could switch between spiral styles by turning a knob. But my concern with that design was that with only one straight blade to do all the work... I wondered whether it might not dull more quickly than a model like this where each style has its own straight cutting blade. That was a decision maker for me. I’ve rated this a four star product only because I feel it could secure to my countertop more evenly. I’ve not had problems with it loosing suction and coming off, however when I push a tough root vegetable through I find myself holding the spiralizer by the top of the unit where the cutting plate is housed in order to give it extra pressure to work against. Honestly, that’s my only negative issue. It’s truly a fine machine. And there are so MANY things to love about it!My daughter owns an older model of this brand and while it performs beautifully cutting wise, it has four suction cup feet on the bottom and I don’t feel it holds as securely as my newer updated model. Plus, she says it’s a real hassle to clean by comparison to mine.Additional extremely enticing things about this updated model is that it has SEVEN different cutting styles which means a lot to me. It comes apart for cleaning, and is top rack DISHWASHER SAFE!!! My daughters older model has all the blades stored within the machine; which sounds attractive, however from a practical standpoint, as stated previously, it makes it much harder to clean than this updated model. I’m grateful to have been fortunate enough to purchase this updated version! 😊I feel this seven blade spiralizer is a great value for the money; especially as compared to many I saw that only offered three or possibly four cutting style options for the same or even considerably higher cost. This was easy to assemble. It’s  intuitive to use, and has honestly been a really valuable addition to our kitchen.You might think it’s something you wouldn’t use very often, but with its ease of cleaning and wide variety of cutting options I use ours literally daily, in cooking regular meals or even simply to prepare a quick and interesting variety of veggie / fruit snacks. If you give it an honest try I can’t imagine you won’t find you’re preparing healthier, more interesting meals, as well as getting more vegetables into your diet, which I personally feel is something we all should all be doing.I’ve found that this machine has definitely changed the way I cook: and that was my goal at the outset. I can quickly make lots of different vegetable forms to include in main dishes, side dishes, side salad types of dishes like quick cucumber salads, or snacks. I’m very glad I purchased this and now having grown used to having it in my kitchen would really be at a loss to cook as healthfully and creatively as I do without it.I do recommend purchasing a few cook books to get you going or searching online for spiralizer vegetable recipes. (There are MANY) I found those recipes inspiring and helpful in aiding me to get the most out of our purchase as well as  improve our diet. There are lots of tips and tricks to learn.I hope you enjoy yours as much as I do mine!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

The OXO Good Grips Silicon Drain Protector catches the hair, doesn't move with water pooling around it, and is easy to clean.  I clean the hair off and rinse it after each use and just set it on the side of my tub to dry.  The water does drain a little slower because it's moving thru the holes and I've seen others cut the lip around the edge, but as long as the water isn't pooling around my ankles, I'm okay with a slower drain for this thing.  I do make sure I rinse the protector and the drain for any remaining soap after I lift the protector out." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It fills the house.I have become a bit of a Bialetti junkie now. I've won an auction for some Bialetti espresso cups and just won an auction for a 9-cup with a set of espresso cups and saucers and a creamer and sugar bowl.

They take up to much space, are rarely used and often times don't do what they promise.  I purchased this on a whim after being impressed with the one my parents had, despite seeing it work I was still skeptical to buy one for my self.  After several uses I can, without question say that this is the most efficient, user friendly, and entertaining kitchen gadget I've owned.This works flawlessly and is so simple.  You remove the top portion of the fruit, line up the circle cutter with the core and turn.  That is it.  When you reach the bottom you will feel the resistance and at that point you just pull the fruit out of the skin.  From there you remove the handle and slide the perfectly cut fruit from cutter.  It is that easy.  All that is left behind is the core and the skin.  We use this to hold fruit salad!We have put it in the dishwasher after each use and there has been no warp or rust.  It is a bit bulky to store but that minor inconvenience is nothing compared how useful this is.If you eat pineapple this is a must have." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

My SO goes nuts because it takes me three months to decide on a kitchen knife.  That being said, I did my usual amount of research before buying this thing and my due diligence did not fail me yet again.  The scraper is seriously so useful.  Being Korean, I make kimchee every couple of months or so - which means a lot of friggin' garlic.  This thing is awesome for mincing up some serious amounts of garlic because bigger chunks tend to get stuck at the top and not get minced evenly.  The scraper solves that problem.  I also tried using it to process crab meat to make it flaky to make California rolls and the motor can handle dry and dense foods like crab meat.  I also tried processing chicken breast for chicken salad with it and no problems there either.  The control options are pretty basic but if you can handle your own around a kitchen then gadgets with crazy settings only get in the way.  With this product, there is absolutely no need to hesitate.  The amazing price is just that - an awesome deal." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Stasher STMK06 Bag Sandwich, 4.5", Raspberry" review="I have several reusable bags, but they're either cloth-based with a food-grade plastic liner or with waterproof fabric, kind of like a jacket's shell. My current ones are zippered and work well, but sometimes I want to use something better for juicier items like fruits. The fabric-based bags can get saturated, and the zipped top provides a small opening. Also, when these full snack and lunch bags get tossed into a bin for a classroom, other students' containers leak.The Stasher bag protects the content from leaking or encroaching spillage, which wipes away easily. I filled it 1/3 with water and placed it upside-down for 4 hours, and the bag did not leak. However, I would not use this to carry around liquid, which can slosh around and weaken the seal - please use a proper jar or bottle for that. The Stasher is not designed for carrying liquid.Needless to say, the seal is great and easy to operate, even for school-aged kids. It is flexible but keeps its form. This is perfect for juicy cut fruits (with a long fork if eating out of the bag) or grapes. I never put grapes in zipped reusable bags, in case the those bags and the grapes inside get crushed, thus making a mess inside and out. Because this one is slightly stiffer, fruits, along with items like crackers and pretzel sticks are better-protected.The 7 Stasher is great for small sandwiches. Because the bag's opening is only a little over 4.5, you can't fit sandwiches made with large bread slices or thick sandwiches. I'd say no bigger than a nut-butter and jelly sandwich of 4.5 by 5. The bread's width in my photo is 4.5, with the Stasher's opening at the top. However, for optimal fit inside, I'd turn the bread 90-degrees to insert it easier. It looks like the widest part should be parallel to the opening, but it works better perpendicularly due to the deceptively wide-looking top appropriate for carrying small items that need to grabbed. (It's geometry.)It washes fine in the dishwasher but can take a while to dry, depending on your dishwasher's drying technology. Be sure to straddle the bag across a few tines to keep the bag open during the wash.This is also great as a travel bag. I haven't gone through airport security where they still want a quart-sized plastic zip-top bag for those without TSA Pre-Check privilege, but I expect this to be acceptable. Also, at NFL football games.I like the bag but do wish it had a larger opening to allow larger sandwiches to be carried to maximize its space, but maybe the smaller opening was a design requirement to ensure corner stability - I don't know. I appreciate a silicone bag as another reusable method to carry small amounts of food or sandwiches. The seal is fantastic." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Occasionally two.  Bottom line is I want GOOD coffee!  My son gave me a Keurig.  I like that I can make one cup with a Keurig since my husband doesn't drink coffee.  I found the coffee to be 'ok'.  My bigger issue is that we are about to full time in an RV.  Space matters.  I thought I would try this since we use a electric tea kettle all the time.  My thought..... no more Keurig for any reason!  This is by far the smoothest coffee!!I have tried smaller French presses and not even close to the quality.  What makes this one lovely is:1.  Just the looks great!!2.  You can make two cups of coffee or a large mug3.  The glass slides out of the stainless steel base.4.  The screen mesh is SEVERAL layers which filter the coffee completely without leaving sludge or coffee grounds5.  They sent a spare set of screens for the press.6.  Screens are sturdy and easy to clean offMy favorite coffee maker!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

After getting tired of filter's not staying in half the time, and the one at work leaking when full... Rolled the dice on this one.Stories about the plastic pour thingy coming off and battery not being replaceable didn't sway me.  I don't need an indicator, and I've been without a plastic pour cover...Water doesn't hit the filter when pouring it, prolonging filter life?  There's an offset hole in the back that water won't come out of (unless you really overfill it and try to spill).  There's a little flap on the front which prevents dust or anything from just falling into the filtered water.  (Read articles on how much plastic micro fibers we consume a year)No problems.  Love the design!  I don't pour water all over the place anymore from a full pre-filter reservoir!  Oh, and the plastic thingy has popped off twice when pulling it out of the fridge.  It basically rests over a bar and can bounce off.  I just put it back on.  It's been about 2 months, but love it above all other designs." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Digital Kitchen Scale / Food Scale - Ultra Slim, Multifunction, Easy to Clean, Large Display (grey)" review="I've used this product for ~ 1 week now, and here're my initial impressions:Pros:- It's an aesthetically very 'clean' looking device.- It has very low profile (making it easy to slide into a drawer with other items if need be)- It's appropriately wide for weighing most items (you can easily place anything short of a normal sized dinner plate and still read the scale)- The display is easy to read from several angles- The display offers several measurement options (grams, ounces, pounds, milliliters, fl ounces, etc).  I particularly like having both the milliliter and fl ounces measurements available.- Device is easy to wipe cleanCons:- As a few others have noted, the battery the unit comes with is pretty close to dead. So be ready to replace it sooner rather than laterI did note a review stating that you have to pour in liquids rather slowly to ensure an ONGOING accurate measurement.  I personally don't consider that a valid criticism.  I'm not aware of any kitchen scale that you can quickly dump a bunch of liquid into it and have it come up with an exact measurement immediately. Keep in mind that, particularly for liquids, you must give the device a chance to sense and then measure the amount of the ingredient being poured (usually continuously I might add) onto it.  You must also give the device a few seconds to ensure that the liquid has leveled out.  So, no, you can't just squirt a bunch of, say, mustard, onto the scale and expect simultaneous weighing.  And pausing 3 seconds or so to ensure an accurate weigh-in of the material is hardly a severe imposition.In any event, this is the second Greater Good item in my possession. Like the other (their bathroom scale), I find it easy to use, accurate, and easy of the eyes as well" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I searched through all the different ones available on Amazon and finally decided on these. I liked the fact that they donate a portion of each sale, and I also love that they advertise you can throw these directly into the washing machine I clean them. Now down to what really matters. Since purchasing these 2 weeks ago, I haven't had to throw away any veggies or fruit! I have been able to keep everything fresh for days longer than usual because these bags let the food breathe!! It is also really nice that they come in a variety of sizes with multiple of each size. What the product description doesn't mention (and should) is that these can be used in the laundry to hold smaller items as well! I have a young son and he loves his wubba nub pacifier. However they have little stuffed animals at the end and get dirty easily. Now that I have these bags, I just collect all the pacifiers and throw them in a bag and wash them together!! They are great for toy storage as well when you are traveling! I love them so much I am ordering another set for myself, and intend to order a set for my mother and mother-in-law as well. Absolutely amazing product!!!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

A number of Amazon reviewers pointed out that straws made out of glass may break and they end up eating pieces of glass at the end. Well, that was not enticing to me so I decided to try stainless steel ones. However, what I did not realize, was that stainless steel straws can feel super cold once you have a tumbler full of ice and it makes sipping experience a little uncomfortable in my opinion. So, here was my issue in short: I personally prefer to sip my drinks through an insulator instead of thermally conductive material. Finally, I was introduced to these new type of straws. Before these, I had no idea that these straws exist! These straws are exactly the ones I have been looking for. The straws in this set are of great quality and it is a beautifully crafted set.One thing to think about is that there is always a risk even for an adult to bite a straw and if you do, you are happy it was a silicon straw instead of a stainless steel one. Are you sure you would like to bite into a metal straw and potentially break your teeth? Dentist visit is not pleasant and it is expensive. - Well, this set comes with two stainless steel straws, but instead of using these straws for the intended purpose one might use stainless steel straws for pitting cherries or olives. Just insert a drinking straw into one end of a cherry and press the pit into a plain glass bottle: the pits are collected in the bottle and extra juice can be filtered out!Someone mentioned that these straws save teeth from yellowing, but no-one mentioned yet that these straws can save you from potential teeth sensitivities from drinking hot and cold drinks, especially for those who have just gone through teeth whitening procedure. I have owned these straws only for a few days, but it pleases me is that these angled straws seem to keep their angled shape really well!Simply put, to pass time sipping of hot coffee or cold drinks can from now on be a greatly enjoyable pleasure." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Bentgo Kids - Leakproof Children’s Lunch Box" review="If you're on the fence about which bento box to order for your child (BENTGO KIDS or YUMBOX), I will compare the two brands in this review.  My family has used both kinds for about a month.**BENTGO KIDS**My 5 year-old kindergartner takes this box for his lunch, and it is truly the better choice for YOUNGER CHILDREN in my opinion. It has a more juvenile color scheme, five small food compartments, DURABLE RUBBER TRIM on the top and bottom, and overall exudes a higher quality product that will withstand more abuse than the Yumbox. The latches are more HEAVY-DUTY than the Yumbox, and although it can be a bit difficult for kids to close at first (it's a tight seal around the inner tray), my son got the hang of it after a couple tries. The Bentgo Kids trays come in three different colors and seem more durable than the Yumbox trays.The Bentgo Kids box doesn't hold a LOT of food, but it is plenty for my son, and I imagine it will provide ample food until he's in second or third grade (probably a good box for 3-8 year-olds?). The largest compartment will fit a half sandwich unless your bread is huge, but then you can just cut it in quarters. The Bentgo Kids shell is a bit larger than the Yumbox, so it's a tight squeeze into my son's soft-sided LL Bean box, but we manage to fit the Bentgo and a Lifefactory water bottle into the LL Bean box.*UPDATE* - We recently purchased an LL Bean Discovery lunch box, and this easily fits either the Bentgo or Yumbox as well as a water bottle and extras.  The Bentgo also fits in a Lands' End ClassMate soft sided lunch box with a Goodbyn water bottle (see photo).Does the Bentgo Kids leak? Nope. The rubber gasket on the lid is impressive, and ranch dressing has stayed neatly in the center dip compartment. The gasket on the Yumbox doesn't seem to be as good, so this is another reason why I like the Bentgo Kids better for younger children. It's pretty much foolproof. To clean, simply remove the inner tray and put it in the dishwasher. I always hand wash the outer shell or at least give it a wipe-down each day.**YUMBOX PANINO**I purchased this Yumbox Panino for my 9 year-old third grader. I like the Yumbox Panino colors and design better for OLDER CHILDREN (maybe 7-12 year-olds?). It's less juvenile than the Bentgo Kids box, and the Panino version has room for a larger sandwich. Since its tray has thin dividers, it will HOLD A BIT MORE FOOD too. The Yumbox has a slightly SMALLER FOOTPRINT than the Bentgo Kids, and it fits snugly in my son's LL Bean lunch box, but his water bottle does make his lunch box lid bulge out - not a big deal.  We have since upgraded to the LL Bean Discovery lunch box, which is much deeper and has plenty of room.  If you only have room for a small, narrow water bottle, the Goodbyn bottle is a great option (found on Amazon).We have packed ranch dressing in the center, and as long as I press down tightly while latching the lid, it doesn't leak. The inner tray has printed text underneath (they are not removable stickers), but it does have a more grown-up look to it than the whimsical designs on other Yumbox trays. Yumbox sells plain trays on their website. The tray easily snaps out for washing in the dishwasher, but we always wash the outer shell by hand.FOUR compartments or SIX? Yes, Yumbox offers two different versions - same size, but the trays have either more or less compartments. I debated greatly over which to buy, but ultimately I decided that the Panino (4 compartment) style would grown with my son better than the 6-compartment Yumbox, and on days when he doesn't pack a large sandwich, I simply use silicone baking cups as dividers. Links to the cupcake liners and leaf-shaped food picks shown in my photo are at the end of this review.SUMMARY:Both boxes have different features, so the box to choose really depends on your child's needs. The YUMBOX PANINO is my favorite for OLDER CHILREN or those who eat larger lunches because of the tray design and color combinations. The BENTGO KIDS is terrific for younger kids as it seems MORE DURABLE yet holds plenty of food for little ones. I do wish the Bentgo Kids box came in more colors, but perhaps this is in the works. For now, my son enjoys using his different-colored trays to switch things up a bit.Links to other products shown in my photo:Silicone Cupcake Liners (this set has red, which my sons had to have):http://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Cupcake-Kitchen-Buddies-Included/dp/B00LR84HXA/ref=sr_1_1?s=kitchen&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1425867226&sr;=1-1Leaf Food Picks: http://www.amazon.com/Tornado-P-2759-Leaf-pick-10P/dp/B0019XLGLE/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1426438596&sr;=1-1&keywords;=leaf+food+picksGoodbyn Bottle:http://www.amazon.com/Goodbyn-20064BT-Bottle-Blue/dp/B0050O92PK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1442187692&sr;=8-1&keywords;=goodbyn+bottleFebruary, 2017 UPDATE:My second grader is still using his Bentgo Kids nearly every day, as it holds more than enough food for his appetite.  The rubber trim began to peel off a bit on the outer container (though I always hand wash it), and Bentgo sent me a replacement!  What a wonderful product and equally great customer service!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

My kids are so picky with the foods they eat.  Mac-n-cheese is a staple in our home and I have spent years trying to figure out how to send it to school with my kids.  Well, this Thermos food jar is the answer to all my problems!  It keeps hot food hot for 5+ hours!!  Enough time for me to heat my child’s meal in the morning and have it still be hot for them at lunch time. Also, cold items stay cold for 7+ hours!  The thermos is very durable too.  The price seems high at first, but when you realize how much of a lifesaver it is, you won’t bat an eye at the price!  I would highly recommend this to anyone with school aged children. I have already purchased additional ones for family and friends.As an Amazon Prime member, I rely heavily on reviews to make informed purchases so I hope you found this helpful.

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Aroma Housewares ARC-914SBD Digital Cool-Touch Rice Cooker and Food Steamer,  8-Cup (Cooked), Silver" review="Okay. I'll give it five stars based on the rice it produces and easy of use and design. It does indeed make pretty much perfect rice, white, brown, wild, etc. as well as other grains. It comes with a little measuring cup. The water level marks inside (none too easy to see, are calibrated for the number of these little cups of grain you use. But the cup is about 3/4 cup, Why? Because that's 1-gou, the standard Japanese rice serving measure. But that's no big deal. Nor is it a problem that the water marks inside are hard to read. Just use one measure of water to one measure of rice. I know. That's different from your usual ratio for stovetop rice.There's a little bit of learning to do at first. I use more water with brown rice, more like 1.5 water to one brown rice. And some rice is drier than other rices, and need more water. I find that you can have a little more water, but you don't want to have too little, because the rice will be less than fully prepared. For instance, I forgot about the little measuring cup and absentmindedly used a full one cup measure but added water to the line for two gou. I got slightly underdone rice.Remember that the cooker knows when the water has been absorbed. Rice cookers work because, so long as there is free water in the pot, the temperature cannot rise above 212F (at sea level). So all the pot need do is stop cooking and reduce temperature to warm when the pot temperature rises about 212F. That's why it works for all grains. And that means the cooker doesn't really know when the rice is done, only when the water is gone.Now, you will see all sorts of different ratios recommended by rice cooker recipes and for different cookers. Lots of people use 1.5:1 for white rice. Quinoa is happier with a 2:1 ratio. Anything reasonably close will work, so long as you use enough water for the grain to be fully cooked when the water is gone. If you use a little more water than you needed, it will go on cooking until absorbed. The worst that will happen is that it might get a little softer than you'd like. And you can even fix it when you open the pot and find it isn't quite done. Just add a bit more water and start the cycle again. The cooker will still know when that water is absorbed. That's the lovely thing about a rice cooker. It can sort of peak under the lid for you, plus it doesn't have to be watched." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Bought this as a replacement after I lost it - disappointed that contigo didn't include any kind of pressure release system.  I live in denver and drive up to the mountains all the time, ~4000ft elevation difference.  If you allow the pressure to build up (spout closed, lid tight), and then open the spout you will get a 3ft stream of water in your face.  If you leave the spout open as you go up in elevation, water will just leak out of the spout and all over your cup holder (lost probably 1/4 of the bottle in my new car before i realized what was happening).  You can remove the straw to avoid this issue, but it makes an annoying squeaking noise if you don't get the drinking angle perfect.  Only other way to avoid the pressure issue is to unscrew the cap to release the pressure every time before drinking, which is obviously not ideal for driving.  I'd recommend getting the no straw version if you fly or drive through mountains frequently." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Unfortunately both kids like to chew on their straw which left me with holy straws. That in turn results in leaking which is not cool. Anyway - I was happy to see that replacement parts are easy to find but the price factor is just ridiculous to say the least. I contacted Thermos customer service and guess what!? They sell the replacement straw (silicone mouth piece plus the hard plastic straw part) for only $1 each plus $3 flat rate for shipping and handling!!!!! I just ordered 4 replacement straws for a total of $7 shipped! Be smart and go through Thermos Customer Service" data-balloon="See users review on this product."
