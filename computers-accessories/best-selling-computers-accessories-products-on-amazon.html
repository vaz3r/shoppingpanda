                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa, 7" Display, 8 GB, Black - with Special Offers" review=" Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. It’s still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and it’s such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7” model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7” 8 or 16 GB; 8” 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8” model is $10 cheaper--- the 7” model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7” model). Note that the Kids edition is only sold with the higher storage (7” – 16 GB; 8” – 32 GB)--- both models can use up to 256 GB microSDXC expansion storage (previously max 128 GB for 7”)--- both models offer Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant at the touch of a button--- both models are physically the same size as previously but slightly lighter – the 8” has lost 1 oz of weight, the 7” is 0.6 oz lighter- BOTH 7” and 8” MODELS are suitable for:--- web surfing using Amazon’s Silk browser--- watching streaming movies or TV shows **--- listening to music **--- reading Kindle books (the 7” is roughly the same size as a Kindle)--- playing games and other apps (within the limitation of Amazon's own ecosystem)--- Kid use – both offer the ability to set up child accounts with restricted access--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- IN ADDITION, THE 8” FIRE HAS:--- slightly larger and higher quality display (but I found both displays to be essentially equivalent in quality)--- larger standard storage (16 GB vs 8 GB)--- better sound – Dolby audio, stereo (7” has mono speaker) **--- larger battery / longer life between charges (Amazon states up to 12 hours, vs up to 8 hrs for the 7”)--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- WHAT DON’T THEY DO AND WHAT ARE THEIR LIMITATIONS?--- Neither model will display 1080p video--- camera specs are poor compared to most current phone and higher priced tablets, so don’t expect high resolution photos--- Sound quality and volume ability is a limitation - see next paragraph--- With limited built in storage, they both rely upon the expansion slot to store larger amounts of photos, videos, or music. Responsiveness using memory from the expansion slot is not quite the same as with a tablet that has greater hard wired storage built-in--- All Fire models are limited to using Amazon’s own Silk web browser, which is less flexible than the regular Chrome or Firefox browsers that can be used on regular Android or Apple tablets- THE SOUND QUALITY AND MAXIMUM VOLUME CAPABILITY IS A WEAK POINT--- Accepting the fact that these are very low cost tablets, they do offer the ability to listen to videos and music and so the built-in speakers will be relied upon by many users. In my opinion the most significant difference between these two Fire models, aside from the screen size, is the difference in sound quality. But I first want to say that neither model has the ability to provide much volume of sound, even at the very highest setting. This is a disappointment.--- The 7 Fire has a single speaker located on the rear of the device, near the bottom. It is weak and produces a very low quality sound. Also, depending on how you are holding the tablet, or if you're using a case to hold it in landscape or portrait mode, the speaker could be covered and even further muffled.--- The 8 HD Fire has better quality sound - two stereo speakers located on the side, positioned so that they will be at the top when the tablet is supported in landscape mode. It also has better sound processing ('Dolby Atmos'), and the sound quality is noticeably better than the 7. Still, the maximum volume capability is modest.--- Bottom line - if you plan to use either model for listening to music or videos, then ear pods or headphones or an external speaker is probably going to be necessary in order to get satisfactory sound. Sound quality is not going to be something owners of these small Fire tablets will be bragging about.- MY IMPRESSIONS OF BOTH MODELS AND HOW THEY COMPAREI purchased both models and illustrate them side by side in my video. They’re obviously very similar in feel and appearance, and the quality is excellent. I also like the matching Amazon cases that protect the screen when not in use and prop the tablet in either landscape or portrait orientation to make it easy to set it on a table to read or watch videos. The cases work exactly the same for both sizes.The display is the most obvious difference – not only size, but the slightly greater display content and resolution. At least that is what the Amazon specs suggest, but to my eyes they are both pretty much the same. I did find that the 7 model seemed to have a slightly brighter display, and the 'whiteness' of the display also seemed to be better.The other difference I wanted to evaluate was the sound quality, since the 7 model has only a single speaker and the 8 model has two (stereo) speakers with Dolby sound processing. For anyone using this tablet for watching videos or listening to music, I thought that would be an important difference.What I found, as also mentioned elsewhere in this review and with respect to the sound quality, was that the limited volume ability of the built-in speakers makes ear pods or headphones or the use of an external speaker almost mandatory. If those considerations are acceptable, then the higher price of the 8 model is probably well worthwhile for users who will use the table very much to listen to music or videos.For reading Kindle books or those who prefer the smaller and lighter size, the 7” model is just great (either model is fine, really).By comparison, the latest small iPad mini has a 7.0” display and is roughly between the 7” and 8” Fire tablets in size (width and height), quite a bit thinner, and about the same weight as the 7” Fire. It’s considerably more powerful and has 128 GB storage standard, but think about it – you can purchase eight 7” Fire tablets for the price of a single iPad mini today! That is really a striking difference.FURTHER THOUGHTSThese two models are the 7th generation Amazon Fire tablet – the first generation was introduced in November, 2011 as the Kindle Fire, offering the same screen size and resolution but a considerably less powerful processor, and selling for $199. Along the way they’ve offered models of various sizes and specifications, and for a short time (generations 3 and 4) their Fire models included the more sophisticated (and expensive) Fire HDX model that may have been intended to be a more direct competitor to Apple’s iPad.Then, in September 2015, Amazon introduced the $49.99 Fire 7, and since that time it seems that they’ve been happy to offer these bargain priced tablets that do everything that most people really need on a day-to-day basis. They make great Kids tablets, too, particularly the ‘Kids Edition’ models that come with the more protective case and 2-year replacement guarantee, just in case your kid drops it in the, ah, swimming pool or some such!WARRANTYThe standard warranty for both Fire models is a short 90-days. Longer warranties - 1, 2 or 3 years - are available at extra cost ($10.99, $14.99, $16.99 respectively). Compared to most devices this is a very short standard warranty.CAMERA QUALITYBoth Fire models have a 2 MP rear-facing 'HD' camera, and a 'VGA' front-facing 0.3 MP camera. These are very mediocre cameras compared to just about any smart phone or tablet currently available and anyone wanting to take photos or videos with their tablet is not going to be satisfied with the quality that can be obtained from these Fire models, but they do suffice if all you want is to take a photo to make a visual note of something for future reference.INCLUDED ACCESSORIESBoth fire models include a 5W wall charger and a VERY SHORT USB cable (just over 3 ft long).As with pretty much all Amazon Fire and Kindle models these days, you can purchase either of these tablets either with or without ‘special offers’. The $15 difference in price eliminates the ads that show when the screen is locked (but disappear when unlocked).For anyone who wants a smaller and lighter weight tablet, these Fire models have become the logical choice. The prices are now so low that they can be a casual purchase for many people, not quite disposable but something easy to pass on when the next new model comes out.I will continue to add more details here as I use these tablets more and have thoughts and comments to share." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have always one for other options thinking that the Kindle Fire was not what I wanted. I was very,  very wrong.  This next generation of  tablets are amazing!It has about 12 hours battery life, it has  many settings that you can use to save your battery by going off Wifi if you don't need it. It is an 8 inch HD display,  it has a quad core processor, 1.3 gigahertz. It it has 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal storage, and a MicroSD slot for up to 256GB.  So you really have a lot of storage! It is so well made, I was surprised,  because  I have three other tablets which take forever to open. The Amazon Fire comes on instantly. You push the on button and it's on. It also contains 'Alexa',  which will be really helpful in accessing information and entertainment.  You can ask questions, play music,  check your calendar,  you can get news,  and weather,  and so much more.  Just press the home button and ask 'Alexa'.  You can enjoy hundreds of movies,  TV shows,  songs,  Kindle ebooks you can even have a text- to-speech narrator,  who will read the book to you! How AWESOME is that?  I can't say enough about this tablet.  I love it.  It has Netflix,  Facebook,  HBO and Spotify. Prime members get unlimited access to so many things at no additional cost. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!  It seems to have brought us into a different venue.  if not just a tablet anymore,  it now has Alexa and she'll show you how to navigate through this tablet. From one app to another just by speaking. It comes in a variety of colored covers. But this is not a tablet case.  If you want a tablet that is completely covered,  front and back,  you will have to buy a case separately. The case that comes with your Kindle Fire is just the back side of the case it does not cover the front. [...] Thank you for reading my review." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

We have a 2 story home and a finished basement.  Prior to googles mesh system I had to have two routers to get a decent signal throughout my home.  I tried extenders but they were worthless.  I had to have several wireless networks setup.  So you would have to switch networks if you wanted a decent signal in the basement.  Once I hooked up this system I had a strong signal from top to bottom of my house.  You will notice the difference in internet speeds in my picture once I switched over to google wifi (June 14).People have complained about loss of flexibity and tweaking since they have to use their phone to configure the google network.  I have no issues with doing anything I did prior to using this.  I work from home and connect to my employer via VPN with no issues.  I can view network traffic, turn off internet for the kids and see how many devices are connected at the click of a button on my phone.  No longing into the router from my desktop or my phones tiny browser.  When you walk from one level to the next, I can see which google router I am connected to.  It automatically switches to the closest one as advertised." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

There are 4 important points I'd like to make:1) All these years I paid for a 50mbps speed from my cable company. I had an older Netgear from 2009 which has served me well all these years (and still works) but I decided it was time to upgrade. Typically I was getting only 12-17mbps through my wi-fi (for example, to my iPhone6). After getting this Nighthawk Router, I now get 57mbps on the same iPhone. All of my devices are much faster now... PS4, iPhones, iPads, Epson Printer, Baby Monitor, Tablets, Roku 3 box, Roku Streaming Stick, etc...2) Cables .... Please note, one other thing I did in addition to getting this router is that I also bought all new cat6 cables (from Amazon Basics), and that has helped the router to connect well to the cable modem. From the router itself, I have a few wired items (Roku 3 box, PS4, my PC). And note that I tested the Roku 3 box, PS4, and PC wirelessly as well. In all conditions, wired with Cat6 cables and/or wi-fi, this Nighthawk router has delivered the speeds I was missing for years.3) Interface.... Also, I like the interface for setting up and using the router. I like that you get two options of 2.4ghz or 5ghz connection. One thing to keep in mind is that some older devices can only use 2.4g so it is that old device itself that limits the connection speed (not your wi-fi necessarily). Newer devices are 5g capable and can maximize the speed capability.4) Security... I also like the Access Control feature so that you have to permit a device to connect to your wi-fi. For example, when I got a new iPad this Christmas, I logged into my wi-fi network and put in the proper password, but it wouldn't connect to the internet. Then I went to the Netgear interface on my PC and it displayed that the iPad had been blocked (because Access Control is turned on). So then I simply hit a check box to allow the iPad onto my home network, and then it connected.Finally, I am not a tech person, I just try to read up on things to the best of my ability. I hope my review helps some of you.5 STARS" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="HP Pavilion 21.5-Inch IPS LED HDMI VGA Monitor" review="Is this a stunning, perfect display? No, not really. But it is perfect as a low-cost secondary display for a laptop. I work from home frequently, and my little laptop screen wasn't cutting it to connect to the bigger dual-monitor display setup I have on my desk at work. I needed something that was fairly inexpensive, but would be easy on the eyes when I'm coding for work. I bought it along with a VESA adapter and a mounting arm, because I like to put my secondary displays in portrait mode, and the stand it comes with doesn't do that. Color and resolution seem pretty good. The back light is nice. There's a tiny bit of light bleed around the edge of mine, but I use it in a fully lit room during daytime hours, so it's not bothersome. I do wish that the place you put the VESA adapter or stand was more centered, because the monitor is a little wobbly, even on the arm I have it mounted on. Otherwise, it's a solid monitor considering I only paid $100 for it. If you're looking for some fancy display for watching high definition movies and playing games, maybe this isn't it. But if you need a second or third monitor for internet browsing / writing code / basic stuff, this is a good choice." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Since the price difference between a 128gb SD and a 256gb SD is about $100, I went with the 128. I use this away from home since it is a lot smaller and lighter than my laptops. This is a lot better than using your cell phone1. The customer service both phone and chat is outstanding.2. The Alexa set up is better than it is on the Generation 5.3. I would suggest that you go to “Settings” and the “Help”. An excellent manual is available in “Help”.4. If you are new to the Fire HD 10, Take your time picking out your aps and delete the one that didn’t work out the way you want.5. The screen size is fine and very clear.6. If you have Alexa play music while you work on something on the Fire, you will find that the battery charge will drop faster. For you senior citizens, I am 83 years old and have no trouble using this unit." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

We are Apple users, everything in my house and office are Apple but seriously when I went to the Apple store Ro buy an iPad  I just felt it was sooo much money for a gadget that my kids throw everywhere, sit on top, etc...so I decided to do some research and found the Amazon Fire 8 kids version to be an interesting option. For the price of one iPad mini I could get 2 Fire HD8 and still save money, so I was like “I’ll try”. Seriously, as soon as I started setting it up I love how everything was so easy and how they separate the content that will be displayed to each kid based on age. A lot of free games, tv shows and movies and the best are the Disney ones, my kids love Disney. The content is free for the first year and then you pay $2.99 per month (the price of one single app on the Apple store)On WiFi, you get the whole set of free shows and stuff and for on the go stuff, I downloaded a bunch of tv shows and games for free with my prime membership.My kids would ask for new games all the time for their iPad and now they couldn’t believe their eyes when they saw all that selection available for them.I definitely recommend this product!!!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa, 7" Display, 8 GB, Marine Blue - with Special Offers" review=" Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. It’s still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and it’s such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7” model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7” 8 or 16 GB; 8” 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8” model is $10 cheaper--- the 7” model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7” model). Note that the Kids edition is only sold with the higher storage (7” – 16 GB; 8” – 32 GB)--- both models can use up to 256 GB microSDXC expansion storage (previously max 128 GB for 7”)--- both models offer Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant at the touch of a button--- both models are physically the same size as previously but slightly lighter – the 8” has lost 1 oz of weight, the 7” is 0.6 oz lighter- BOTH 7” and 8” MODELS are suitable for:--- web surfing using Amazon’s Silk browser--- watching streaming movies or TV shows **--- listening to music **--- reading Kindle books (the 7” is roughly the same size as a Kindle)--- playing games and other apps (within the limitation of Amazon's own ecosystem)--- Kid use – both offer the ability to set up child accounts with restricted access--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- IN ADDITION, THE 8” FIRE HAS:--- slightly larger and higher quality display (but I found both displays to be essentially equivalent in quality)--- larger standard storage (16 GB vs 8 GB)--- better sound – Dolby audio, stereo (7” has mono speaker) **--- larger battery / longer life between charges (Amazon states up to 12 hours, vs up to 8 hrs for the 7”)--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- WHAT DON’T THEY DO AND WHAT ARE THEIR LIMITATIONS?--- Neither model will display 1080p video--- camera specs are poor compared to most current phone and higher priced tablets, so don’t expect high resolution photos--- Sound quality and volume ability is a limitation - see next paragraph--- With limited built in storage, they both rely upon the expansion slot to store larger amounts of photos, videos, or music. Responsiveness using memory from the expansion slot is not quite the same as with a tablet that has greater hard wired storage built-in--- All Fire models are limited to using Amazon’s own Silk web browser, which is less flexible than the regular Chrome or Firefox browsers that can be used on regular Android or Apple tablets- THE SOUND QUALITY AND MAXIMUM VOLUME CAPABILITY IS A WEAK POINT--- Accepting the fact that these are very low cost tablets, they do offer the ability to listen to videos and music and so the built-in speakers will be relied upon by many users. In my opinion the most significant difference between these two Fire models, aside from the screen size, is the difference in sound quality. But I first want to say that neither model has the ability to provide much volume of sound, even at the very highest setting. This is a disappointment.--- The 7 Fire has a single speaker located on the rear of the device, near the bottom. It is weak and produces a very low quality sound. Also, depending on how you are holding the tablet, or if you're using a case to hold it in landscape or portrait mode, the speaker could be covered and even further muffled.--- The 8 HD Fire has better quality sound - two stereo speakers located on the side, positioned so that they will be at the top when the tablet is supported in landscape mode. It also has better sound processing ('Dolby Atmos'), and the sound quality is noticeably better than the 7. Still, the maximum volume capability is modest.--- Bottom line - if you plan to use either model for listening to music or videos, then ear pods or headphones or an external speaker is probably going to be necessary in order to get satisfactory sound. Sound quality is not going to be something owners of these small Fire tablets will be bragging about.- MY IMPRESSIONS OF BOTH MODELS AND HOW THEY COMPAREI purchased both models and illustrate them side by side in my video. They’re obviously very similar in feel and appearance, and the quality is excellent. I also like the matching Amazon cases that protect the screen when not in use and prop the tablet in either landscape or portrait orientation to make it easy to set it on a table to read or watch videos. The cases work exactly the same for both sizes.The display is the most obvious difference – not only size, but the slightly greater display content and resolution. At least that is what the Amazon specs suggest, but to my eyes they are both pretty much the same. I did find that the 7 model seemed to have a slightly brighter display, and the 'whiteness' of the display also seemed to be better.The other difference I wanted to evaluate was the sound quality, since the 7 model has only a single speaker and the 8 model has two (stereo) speakers with Dolby sound processing. For anyone using this tablet for watching videos or listening to music, I thought that would be an important difference.What I found, as also mentioned elsewhere in this review and with respect to the sound quality, was that the limited volume ability of the built-in speakers makes ear pods or headphones or the use of an external speaker almost mandatory. If those considerations are acceptable, then the higher price of the 8 model is probably well worthwhile for users who will use the table very much to listen to music or videos.For reading Kindle books or those who prefer the smaller and lighter size, the 7” model is just great (either model is fine, really).By comparison, the latest small iPad mini has a 7.0” display and is roughly between the 7” and 8” Fire tablets in size (width and height), quite a bit thinner, and about the same weight as the 7” Fire. It’s considerably more powerful and has 128 GB storage standard, but think about it – you can purchase eight 7” Fire tablets for the price of a single iPad mini today! That is really a striking difference.FURTHER THOUGHTSThese two models are the 7th generation Amazon Fire tablet – the first generation was introduced in November, 2011 as the Kindle Fire, offering the same screen size and resolution but a considerably less powerful processor, and selling for $199. Along the way they’ve offered models of various sizes and specifications, and for a short time (generations 3 and 4) their Fire models included the more sophisticated (and expensive) Fire HDX model that may have been intended to be a more direct competitor to Apple’s iPad.Then, in September 2015, Amazon introduced the $49.99 Fire 7, and since that time it seems that they’ve been happy to offer these bargain priced tablets that do everything that most people really need on a day-to-day basis. They make great Kids tablets, too, particularly the ‘Kids Edition’ models that come with the more protective case and 2-year replacement guarantee, just in case your kid drops it in the, ah, swimming pool or some such!WARRANTYThe standard warranty for both Fire models is a short 90-days. Longer warranties - 1, 2 or 3 years - are available at extra cost ($10.99, $14.99, $16.99 respectively). Compared to most devices this is a very short standard warranty.CAMERA QUALITYBoth Fire models have a 2 MP rear-facing 'HD' camera, and a 'VGA' front-facing 0.3 MP camera. These are very mediocre cameras compared to just about any smart phone or tablet currently available and anyone wanting to take photos or videos with their tablet is not going to be satisfied with the quality that can be obtained from these Fire models, but they do suffice if all you want is to take a photo to make a visual note of something for future reference.INCLUDED ACCESSORIESBoth fire models include a 5W wall charger and a VERY SHORT USB cable (just over 3 ft long).As with pretty much all Amazon Fire and Kindle models these days, you can purchase either of these tablets either with or without ‘special offers’. The $15 difference in price eliminates the ads that show when the screen is locked (but disappear when unlocked).For anyone who wants a smaller and lighter weight tablet, these Fire models have become the logical choice. The prices are now so low that they can be a casual purchase for many people, not quite disposable but something easy to pass on when the next new model comes out.I will continue to add more details here as I use these tablets more and have thoughts and comments to share." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I've only stuck to those that were packed in with my consoles (cheap, I know.) The high prices of Turtle beaches and the like always turned me off of purchasing one. That was until I saw these. 27.99? Can't go wrong with that. Most would assume that the cheaper the price, the cheaper the quality... Well thats the exact opposite with these.First off these are comfortable as hell. They fit perfectly over my ears, cutting off 90% of the sounds around me and they just feel so good around my ears.They don't feel sore after long sessions either.The audio quality is perfect. Whether its a youtube video or the sounds of war in Battlefield 1, everything sounds crystal clear. Most importantly the bass is booming! The volume control is easy to use and percise.As a added bonus it comes with multiple adapters for other consoles and the like. These headsets are compatible with Xbox one, Ps4, Switch and gaming PCs.I could not be happier with this headset. Comfortable, precise and high quality. What more could you ask for? Especially for the price. Great Product!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I know it is marketed as a tablet stand, but I bought it primarily for my Note 4 phone. It works well for Kindles too. I also use it to hold a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 tablet in portrait mode (keyboard detached).I know, why use a Surface in portrait mode? Because I want to run certain Android apps on this Windows tablet. (This is possible with an Android emulator.) Many Android apps were designed for phone screens in portrait mode. So, hence.  The Surface is awesome, but there's no built-in way to hold the tablet upright in portrait mode. This stand works well for this purpose when putting its arm at a slight, not quite vertical angle. The issue with the Surface in portrait mode on this stand is the center of gravity and where the stand's topmost support point hits the tablet. Normal pressing and tapping and pen usage is just fine. Just test it yourself a bit to get used to how hard you can (and cannot) press at the top of the screen so you don't accidentally tip it over. In landscape mode there are no issues at all (but you probably would just use the Surface's built-in stand)." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa, 7" Display, 8 GB, Punch Red - with Special Offers" review=" Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. It’s still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and it’s such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7” model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7” 8 or 16 GB; 8” 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8” model is $10 cheaper--- the 7” model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7” model). Note that the Kids edition is only sold with the higher storage (7” – 16 GB; 8” – 32 GB)--- both models can use up to 256 GB microSDXC expansion storage (previously max 128 GB for 7”)--- both models offer Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant at the touch of a button--- both models are physically the same size as previously but slightly lighter – the 8” has lost 1 oz of weight, the 7” is 0.6 oz lighter- BOTH 7” and 8” MODELS are suitable for:--- web surfing using Amazon’s Silk browser--- watching streaming movies or TV shows **--- listening to music **--- reading Kindle books (the 7” is roughly the same size as a Kindle)--- playing games and other apps (within the limitation of Amazon's own ecosystem)--- Kid use – both offer the ability to set up child accounts with restricted access--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- IN ADDITION, THE 8” FIRE HAS:--- slightly larger and higher quality display (but I found both displays to be essentially equivalent in quality)--- larger standard storage (16 GB vs 8 GB)--- better sound – Dolby audio, stereo (7” has mono speaker) **--- larger battery / longer life between charges (Amazon states up to 12 hours, vs up to 8 hrs for the 7”)--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- WHAT DON’T THEY DO AND WHAT ARE THEIR LIMITATIONS?--- Neither model will display 1080p video--- camera specs are poor compared to most current phone and higher priced tablets, so don’t expect high resolution photos--- Sound quality and volume ability is a limitation - see next paragraph--- With limited built in storage, they both rely upon the expansion slot to store larger amounts of photos, videos, or music. Responsiveness using memory from the expansion slot is not quite the same as with a tablet that has greater hard wired storage built-in--- All Fire models are limited to using Amazon’s own Silk web browser, which is less flexible than the regular Chrome or Firefox browsers that can be used on regular Android or Apple tablets- THE SOUND QUALITY AND MAXIMUM VOLUME CAPABILITY IS A WEAK POINT--- Accepting the fact that these are very low cost tablets, they do offer the ability to listen to videos and music and so the built-in speakers will be relied upon by many users. In my opinion the most significant difference between these two Fire models, aside from the screen size, is the difference in sound quality. But I first want to say that neither model has the ability to provide much volume of sound, even at the very highest setting. This is a disappointment.--- The 7 Fire has a single speaker located on the rear of the device, near the bottom. It is weak and produces a very low quality sound. Also, depending on how you are holding the tablet, or if you're using a case to hold it in landscape or portrait mode, the speaker could be covered and even further muffled.--- The 8 HD Fire has better quality sound - two stereo speakers located on the side, positioned so that they will be at the top when the tablet is supported in landscape mode. It also has better sound processing ('Dolby Atmos'), and the sound quality is noticeably better than the 7. Still, the maximum volume capability is modest.--- Bottom line - if you plan to use either model for listening to music or videos, then ear pods or headphones or an external speaker is probably going to be necessary in order to get satisfactory sound. Sound quality is not going to be something owners of these small Fire tablets will be bragging about.- MY IMPRESSIONS OF BOTH MODELS AND HOW THEY COMPAREI purchased both models and illustrate them side by side in my video. They’re obviously very similar in feel and appearance, and the quality is excellent. I also like the matching Amazon cases that protect the screen when not in use and prop the tablet in either landscape or portrait orientation to make it easy to set it on a table to read or watch videos. The cases work exactly the same for both sizes.The display is the most obvious difference – not only size, but the slightly greater display content and resolution. At least that is what the Amazon specs suggest, but to my eyes they are both pretty much the same. I did find that the 7 model seemed to have a slightly brighter display, and the 'whiteness' of the display also seemed to be better.The other difference I wanted to evaluate was the sound quality, since the 7 model has only a single speaker and the 8 model has two (stereo) speakers with Dolby sound processing. For anyone using this tablet for watching videos or listening to music, I thought that would be an important difference.What I found, as also mentioned elsewhere in this review and with respect to the sound quality, was that the limited volume ability of the built-in speakers makes ear pods or headphones or the use of an external speaker almost mandatory. If those considerations are acceptable, then the higher price of the 8 model is probably well worthwhile for users who will use the table very much to listen to music or videos.For reading Kindle books or those who prefer the smaller and lighter size, the 7” model is just great (either model is fine, really).By comparison, the latest small iPad mini has a 7.0” display and is roughly between the 7” and 8” Fire tablets in size (width and height), quite a bit thinner, and about the same weight as the 7” Fire. It’s considerably more powerful and has 128 GB storage standard, but think about it – you can purchase eight 7” Fire tablets for the price of a single iPad mini today! That is really a striking difference.FURTHER THOUGHTSThese two models are the 7th generation Amazon Fire tablet – the first generation was introduced in November, 2011 as the Kindle Fire, offering the same screen size and resolution but a considerably less powerful processor, and selling for $199. Along the way they’ve offered models of various sizes and specifications, and for a short time (generations 3 and 4) their Fire models included the more sophisticated (and expensive) Fire HDX model that may have been intended to be a more direct competitor to Apple’s iPad.Then, in September 2015, Amazon introduced the $49.99 Fire 7, and since that time it seems that they’ve been happy to offer these bargain priced tablets that do everything that most people really need on a day-to-day basis. They make great Kids tablets, too, particularly the ‘Kids Edition’ models that come with the more protective case and 2-year replacement guarantee, just in case your kid drops it in the, ah, swimming pool or some such!WARRANTYThe standard warranty for both Fire models is a short 90-days. Longer warranties - 1, 2 or 3 years - are available at extra cost ($10.99, $14.99, $16.99 respectively). Compared to most devices this is a very short standard warranty.CAMERA QUALITYBoth Fire models have a 2 MP rear-facing 'HD' camera, and a 'VGA' front-facing 0.3 MP camera. These are very mediocre cameras compared to just about any smart phone or tablet currently available and anyone wanting to take photos or videos with their tablet is not going to be satisfied with the quality that can be obtained from these Fire models, but they do suffice if all you want is to take a photo to make a visual note of something for future reference.INCLUDED ACCESSORIESBoth fire models include a 5W wall charger and a VERY SHORT USB cable (just over 3 ft long).As with pretty much all Amazon Fire and Kindle models these days, you can purchase either of these tablets either with or without ‘special offers’. The $15 difference in price eliminates the ads that show when the screen is locked (but disappear when unlocked).For anyone who wants a smaller and lighter weight tablet, these Fire models have become the logical choice. The prices are now so low that they can be a casual purchase for many people, not quite disposable but something easy to pass on when the next new model comes out.I will continue to add more details here as I use these tablets more and have thoughts and comments to share." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have always one for other options thinking that the Kindle Fire was not what I wanted. I was very,  very wrong.  This next generation of  tablets are amazing!It has about 12 hours battery life, it has  many settings that you can use to save your battery by going off Wifi if you don't need it. It is an 8 inch HD display,  it has a quad core processor, 1.3 gigahertz. It it has 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal storage, and a MicroSD slot for up to 256GB.  So you really have a lot of storage! It is so well made, I was surprised,  because  I have three other tablets which take forever to open. The Amazon Fire comes on instantly. You push the on button and it's on. It also contains 'Alexa',  which will be really helpful in accessing information and entertainment.  You can ask questions, play music,  check your calendar,  you can get news,  and weather,  and so much more.  Just press the home button and ask 'Alexa'.  You can enjoy hundreds of movies,  TV shows,  songs,  Kindle ebooks you can even have a text- to-speech narrator,  who will read the book to you! How AWESOME is that?  I can't say enough about this tablet.  I love it.  It has Netflix,  Facebook,  HBO and Spotify. Prime members get unlimited access to so many things at no additional cost. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!  It seems to have brought us into a different venue.  if not just a tablet anymore,  it now has Alexa and she'll show you how to navigate through this tablet. From one app to another just by speaking. It comes in a variety of colored covers. But this is not a tablet case.  If you want a tablet that is completely covered,  front and back,  you will have to buy a case separately. The case that comes with your Kindle Fire is just the back side of the case it does not cover the front. [...] Thank you for reading my review." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire HD 8 Kids Edition Tablet, 8" HD Display, 32 GB, Pink Kid-Proof Case" review="So I have 2 boys a 6 years old and a 3 year old, they used to share one iPad before and I was planning on buying another one so they could have their own. We are Apple users, everything in my house and office are Apple but seriously when I went to the Apple store Ro buy an iPad  I just felt it was sooo much money for a gadget that my kids throw everywhere, sit on top, etc...so I decided to do some research and found the Amazon Fire 8 kids version to be an interesting option. For the price of one iPad mini I could get 2 Fire HD8 and still save money, so I was like “I’ll try”. Seriously, as soon as I started setting it up I love how everything was so easy and how they separate the content that will be displayed to each kid based on age. A lot of free games, tv shows and movies and the best are the Disney ones, my kids love Disney. The content is free for the first year and then you pay $2.99 per month (the price of one single app on the Apple store)On WiFi, you get the whole set of free shows and stuff and for on the go stuff, I downloaded a bunch of tv shows and games for free with my prime membership.My kids would ask for new games all the time for their iPad and now they couldn’t believe their eyes when they saw all that selection available for them.I definitely recommend this product!!!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="NETGEAR CM500-1AZNAS (16x4) DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem, Max download speeds of 686Mbps, Certified for Xfinity from Comcast, Spectrum, Cox, Cablevision & more" review="I don't do reviews often but I want to help my geek friends save days of research and frustration that I went through to finally get the absolute most speed out of my Gigabit internet.  There's some golden nuggets here that you need to know.When I first upgraded to the new gigabit here in Denver (from Xfinity), it was using their new Cable Modem/Router device (XB6-A) and I was only getting 500 Mbps download speed. It was also lagging in our house when several people were gaming and others were downloading, or even accessing intensive web-pages. (lagging = pings were going up).Since upgrading to this Netgear CM1000, upgrading my cabling, and factory resetting my router, I'm now getting the most download throughput (~941 Mbps) and the lowest pings I've EVER seen! Connection is rock solid throughout the house.SHORT ANSWER: Get this Netgear CM, upgrade your ethernet cables to Cat 6 (or Cat 5E for short distances) and then Factory Reset your router to get the most speed. You still may need a new router to reach gigabit speeds. I'm getting the most download throughput (~941 Mbps) and the lowest pings I've EVER seen!I did lots of tests comparing this cable modem to the XB6-A that Xfinity provided. Here are some big things I learned:1) Make sure your ethernet cables going from the cable modem to the router and from the router to your PC are CAT6 or at least CAT5E (for short distances).2) Upgrading to this Netgear CM1000 Cable Modem LOWERED my ping/latency compared to the XB6-A that Xfinity provided. I just got a 5 MS Ping to the google server here in Denver! UNHEARD OF. Most of the time it's around 8-9ms with this new cable modem.  I was getting 11-14 w/ the Xfinity modem. If you're a gamer, a lower ping matters!3) The Xfinity XB6-A modem/router combo doesn't work too well when you have your own router also connected to it.  Xfinity recommends you only use their device and disconnect your router.4) Around 941 mbps is the max download speed that modern gigabit routers/switches can do right now so don't be worried if you can't get above that.5) Many routers can't handle gigabit download speeds, especially if you've enabled any of the features like QoS, Traffic Meter, Keyword block, etc. My Netgear Nighthawk (R7000) was only getting 400-500 mbps (using speedtest) because I had enabled some of these features.  Even when I disabled these features, the speed was still low. Doing a FACTORY reset fixed it, and now I'm getting 937 - 943 mbps download speed!!!The reason these routers slow down when you enable extra features is because it disables CTF (cut through forwarding) and the router no longer uses it's faster processor. Some of the newer routers can still maintain max download speeds of 941 mbps while also allowing you to use QoS and other features.6) There's a great website called Small Net Builder that compared routers to see which could reach 941 mbps download speed. I recommend you check that out if you need a new router.Keep in mind that this Netgear CM1000 is JUST a cable modem. It's not a router. So if you only have 1 device you want to wire into it, you're fine but if you want to have more devices, and wireless, then you'll need a router too.The Xfinity provided XB6-A is both a cable modem and a wireless router in one. I personally think it has some flaws that need to be worked out but appears to be a beefy piece of hardware. You can save yourself the $10/month rental by getting this Netgear CM1000.P.S. I do plan to upgrade my router so that I can still get 941 mbps download speed while enabling QoS. With QoS, it will set aside a portion of your bandwidth (say 20%) for high priority traffic like gaming that need low latency, and then it will limit all other connections (like large downloads) to the other 80% the connection. Keep in mind, if you enable this and run a speedtest, it will appear lower simply because it's now reserving part of your bandwidth for other devices/traffic in your home." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Sometimes I'll extend USB ports from my computers to desk, I have some extending my phone and tablet charging cables, and I have one extending the USB port on the back of my television. It has worked great and as expected for all these uses.The cables feel durable and haven't failed me yet. I also haven't had issues plugging them into anything or plugging things into them whereas another USB extender I had actually got my charging cable stuck inside and broke it when I tried to remove it. They work great and for the price they are easy to recommend." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

When I took it out of the box, I was impressed by the size of the screen. It's quite wide and sturdy so you have no fear of it wobbling around. So on to the testing. The hdmi and vga are good for selection. I use hdmi and turned it on. The images are gorgeous. The IPS definitely makes the FHD shine thru and thru. Images are vivid, movies are amazing, and you have plenty of room to see all of your windows. Everything was great....till I switched the sound from my laptop to the monitor. They REALLY dropped the ball there. I have to put the sound up on the monitor AND my laptop to even hear anything! I barely have to turn up the sound on my laptop to hear it so I don't know if they put all their money into the screen or decided the speakers were a last minute decision. SO if you plan on using this monitor with a tower pc, please have external speakers as your default because the monitor speakers are mediocre. So for those looking for a replacement monitor, a low price IPS screen, or a productivity/work/some gaming screen, I can suggest this to you. Those looking for a monitor with minimum fuss to it, I can sortof recommend it to you because it's easy to setup. But I strongly advise you to have external speakers in order to enjoy any sound while being hooked up to this monitor." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

This listing has since been updated to include other cablemodem options. Presumably the seller wanted to make sure people with links to the original product didn't miss that there were newer options.Even in a 105Mbps or 150Mbps Comcast region, this modem is worth consideration.Most of Comcast's DOCSIS 3.0 cable modems have only 4 or 8 bonded channels, while most of their regions support bonding 16 downstream channels. This modem has 16 channels available. While 4 and 8 channel units are capable of delivering Comcast's promised speeds, users will be more subject to local congestion. With cablemodem, you share channels with your neighbors. You benefit from full speed on each channel when neighbors are idle, but if neighbors are consuming bandwidth the channels have contention.When more channels are available, DOCSIS cable modems can distribute traffic between more potential channels. As channel usage drops, your modem's traffic will shift to less-busy channels.For comparison, I upgraded from an 8 channel modem to this 16 channel modem.Old modem: On a 105Mbps plan, I typically peaked at 105Mbps while maintaining about 95Mbps. With 150Mbps, I peaked at 150Mbps while averaging about 125Mbps.This modem: 105Mbps plan peaks at 140Mbps and maintains 105Mbps. 150Mbps plan peaks at 180Mbps and maintains 150Mbps.In other words, on the very same plan, I enjoy 10-20% faster downstream with the hardware as the only difference.Results will vary from area to area, depending on the state of Comcast's network. They're preparing for faster speeds in some areas and upgrading equipment in advance, but other areas without competition may tend to linger on less advanced hardware." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet, 7" Display, 16 GB, Blue Kid-Proof Case" review="I am really sad to give this review anything less than 5 stars, but I would appreciate the understanding as to why. We have owned, now, 4 different Kids Edition Tablets. They have their pros and cons for sure, but we have started to notice a trend with each one. Before I get into why I am no longer a fan of these, I want to express my love for the content and set up.Pros: They have amazing options for kids, of all ages -- and an option to even set up a Kindle based on the age range. There is a huge variety of movies, shows, books, games, characters, etc. and that is great! There is no shortage of entertainment that these can't provide to children, as young at 24 months. We have found that our girls openly express the things they are learning, and we've watched their progress - which, as a parent, you wouldn't ask for much more! The battery life is also great so that helps keep kids entertained for hours, especially on a long car drive. Having the ability to expand the storage is great, and somewhat of a necessity as kids have a tendency to just click everything they see, downloading many gigs of data almost immediately. The case is also an added bonus. It does a great job of protecting the screen and for smaller kids, that's extremely important in extending the usage and life of your device. Kids can easily navigate the menus, parents can monitor the usage and set limits, and of course, the kids portion of the tablet is an add on so adults can use this tablet with ease whenever they choose to: with the ability to access the internet, social media, email, books, video apps, and everything else.Cons: There is only one major downside to these devices, but unfortunately we have seen the same thing happen with all 4 of the kids kindles we have had. The charger ports fail so quickly. The chargers are never secure, they wiggle after days of use and after about a month, the only way to successfully charge your device is through a stabilizer and tape. This method only seems to work out for so long before charging becomes an impossibility and you are back to returning your kindle. Thankfully they now have a 2 year return ability, but previously it was only 1 and we ended up with two non-charging kindles by the end of it. It has been the most disappointing part of having these and you can imagine our kids upset when they find out they no longer can play with their favorite tablet until we can get them, yet again, another one. Over time, the battery life also begins to suffer so I wish the batteries that were used for these items could hold a charge for a longer period of time. There comes a point, right around a year of having the device where a full battery may only last through a movie - we have given our daughter's their devices fully charged at 9am and they are dead, or close to dying, by no later than 11 or noon.These are my only two complaints, unfortunately they are pretty serious complaints and they affect the ability to use the items for as long as I believe you should be able to. If these issues were to be fixed, these would be the perfect kids electronic. Until then, I am definitely wary of purchasing any more of these devices." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have always one for other options thinking that the Kindle Fire was not what I wanted. I was very,  very wrong.  This next generation of  tablets are amazing!It has about 12 hours battery life, it has  many settings that you can use to save your battery by going off Wifi if you don't need it. It is an 8 inch HD display,  it has a quad core processor, 1.3 gigahertz. It it has 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal storage, and a MicroSD slot for up to 256GB.  So you really have a lot of storage! It is so well made, I was surprised,  because  I have three other tablets which take forever to open. The Amazon Fire comes on instantly. You push the on button and it's on. It also contains 'Alexa',  which will be really helpful in accessing information and entertainment.  You can ask questions, play music,  check your calendar,  you can get news,  and weather,  and so much more.  Just press the home button and ask 'Alexa'.  You can enjoy hundreds of movies,  TV shows,  songs,  Kindle ebooks you can even have a text- to-speech narrator,  who will read the book to you! How AWESOME is that?  I can't say enough about this tablet.  I love it.  It has Netflix,  Facebook,  HBO and Spotify. Prime members get unlimited access to so many things at no additional cost. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!  It seems to have brought us into a different venue.  if not just a tablet anymore,  it now has Alexa and she'll show you how to navigate through this tablet. From one app to another just by speaking. It comes in a variety of colored covers. But this is not a tablet case.  If you want a tablet that is completely covered,  front and back,  you will have to buy a case separately. The case that comes with your Kindle Fire is just the back side of the case it does not cover the front. [...] Thank you for reading my review." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I didn't want to pay $80 for an Apple adapter, so I was delighted to find these fine people selling genuine Apple adapters for $60.  I sorta wondered how they could manage to do that (Apple tightly controls the market price of their products), but I wanted to believe.The adapter arrived working and it looked very much like a real OEM Apple adapter.  All the fine print, certifications, etc. looked like my original adapter.But after 10 months of use, it died.  On a hunch, I opened it up.  It was a cheap knockoff.  It was easy to tell.  What I saw was basically the same as what this tear down found: [...]Note how official the fake on that web page looks.  Well that's what you're getting here.  I've attached a photo of what I found.  Note the low component density and terrible soldering.  It's crap.So I paid $60 for a charger that lasted 10 months (apparently I was one of the lucky ones to have it last that long).  Now I've got to suck it up and pay $80 for a real one.$60 to learn what I already knew:  TANSTAAFL, and you get what you pay for.  Don't waste your money here.Edit: For some reason this charger is $80 now - don't know if that means they are now selling actual Apple chargers or if they're just getting $20 more for their cheap knock-off.  Either way I'd avoid this vendor." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

This product was the perfect fix, and with it being half the price of the Microsoft version a great deal. I will say that there is a slight buzzing noise but nothing major. I would strongly suggest the super quiet version because I don't think any more noise from the power brick would be suitable for gaming. Again it's great and I strongly suggest this power brick for anybody with Xbox power problems" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Since the price difference between a 128gb SD and a 256gb SD is about $100, I went with the 128. I use this away from home since it is a lot smaller and lighter than my laptops. This is a lot better than using your cell phone1. The customer service both phone and chat is outstanding.2. The Alexa set up is better than it is on the Generation 5.3. I would suggest that you go to “Settings” and the “Help”. An excellent manual is available in “Help”.4. If you are new to the Fire HD 10, Take your time picking out your aps and delete the one that didn’t work out the way you want.5. The screen size is fine and very clear.6. If you have Alexa play music while you work on something on the Fire, you will find that the battery charge will drop faster. For you senior citizens, I am 83 years old and have no trouble using this unit." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I bought two of these, and spent about the same amount of money as if I were to buy a decent 24 monitor. They're a little small, but not bad from a foot or so away. The number of inputs is awesome, but I would prefer 2 HDMI over 1 HDMI, VGA, and DVI; today's devices primarily use HDMI. The speakers are, eh, not impressive. At least they're there, unlike a lot of monitors, but the volume is limited and the quality is poor- don't buy this for the speaker.My biggest complaint is that neck that goes into the base is NOT (easily) removable. So, if you plan to mount this on a wall or stand, like me, then you'll have an unsightly black neck sticking out the bottom. I've read you can remove the monitor frame and unscrew the neck, but I tried this and wasn't able to separate the frame without feeling like I was going to break something." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have a Note 8 and these cables are compatible with fast charging as long as your charger plug is also compatible. Ordered a pack of these for the misses, liked them so much I needed my own. One that came in my pack did not work. I contacted Anker directly through their support email address and they responded within a few hours, even though it was not during their business hours, and then even apologized for taking so long to respond. They very promptly sent out the next higher model (USB 3.0 rather than 2.0, which I did not request) as a replacement, free of charge, and asked that I send back the faulty one via prepaid shipping label for their quality control team to analyze. Anker takes customer service very seriously and it shows! Thanks guys :)" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa, 7" Display, 8 GB, Canary Yellow - with Special Offers" review=" Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. It’s still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and it’s such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7” model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7” 8 or 16 GB; 8” 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8” model is $10 cheaper--- the 7” model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7” model). Note that the Kids edition is only sold with the higher storage (7” – 16 GB; 8” – 32 GB)--- both models can use up to 256 GB microSDXC expansion storage (previously max 128 GB for 7”)--- both models offer Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant at the touch of a button--- both models are physically the same size as previously but slightly lighter – the 8” has lost 1 oz of weight, the 7” is 0.6 oz lighter- BOTH 7” and 8” MODELS are suitable for:--- web surfing using Amazon’s Silk browser--- watching streaming movies or TV shows **--- listening to music **--- reading Kindle books (the 7” is roughly the same size as a Kindle)--- playing games and other apps (within the limitation of Amazon's own ecosystem)--- Kid use – both offer the ability to set up child accounts with restricted access--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- IN ADDITION, THE 8” FIRE HAS:--- slightly larger and higher quality display (but I found both displays to be essentially equivalent in quality)--- larger standard storage (16 GB vs 8 GB)--- better sound – Dolby audio, stereo (7” has mono speaker) **--- larger battery / longer life between charges (Amazon states up to 12 hours, vs up to 8 hrs for the 7”)--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- WHAT DON’T THEY DO AND WHAT ARE THEIR LIMITATIONS?--- Neither model will display 1080p video--- camera specs are poor compared to most current phone and higher priced tablets, so don’t expect high resolution photos--- Sound quality and volume ability is a limitation - see next paragraph--- With limited built in storage, they both rely upon the expansion slot to store larger amounts of photos, videos, or music. Responsiveness using memory from the expansion slot is not quite the same as with a tablet that has greater hard wired storage built-in--- All Fire models are limited to using Amazon’s own Silk web browser, which is less flexible than the regular Chrome or Firefox browsers that can be used on regular Android or Apple tablets- THE SOUND QUALITY AND MAXIMUM VOLUME CAPABILITY IS A WEAK POINT--- Accepting the fact that these are very low cost tablets, they do offer the ability to listen to videos and music and so the built-in speakers will be relied upon by many users. In my opinion the most significant difference between these two Fire models, aside from the screen size, is the difference in sound quality. But I first want to say that neither model has the ability to provide much volume of sound, even at the very highest setting. This is a disappointment.--- The 7 Fire has a single speaker located on the rear of the device, near the bottom. It is weak and produces a very low quality sound. Also, depending on how you are holding the tablet, or if you're using a case to hold it in landscape or portrait mode, the speaker could be covered and even further muffled.--- The 8 HD Fire has better quality sound - two stereo speakers located on the side, positioned so that they will be at the top when the tablet is supported in landscape mode. It also has better sound processing ('Dolby Atmos'), and the sound quality is noticeably better than the 7. Still, the maximum volume capability is modest.--- Bottom line - if you plan to use either model for listening to music or videos, then ear pods or headphones or an external speaker is probably going to be necessary in order to get satisfactory sound. Sound quality is not going to be something owners of these small Fire tablets will be bragging about.- MY IMPRESSIONS OF BOTH MODELS AND HOW THEY COMPAREI purchased both models and illustrate them side by side in my video. They’re obviously very similar in feel and appearance, and the quality is excellent. I also like the matching Amazon cases that protect the screen when not in use and prop the tablet in either landscape or portrait orientation to make it easy to set it on a table to read or watch videos. The cases work exactly the same for both sizes.The display is the most obvious difference – not only size, but the slightly greater display content and resolution. At least that is what the Amazon specs suggest, but to my eyes they are both pretty much the same. I did find that the 7 model seemed to have a slightly brighter display, and the 'whiteness' of the display also seemed to be better.The other difference I wanted to evaluate was the sound quality, since the 7 model has only a single speaker and the 8 model has two (stereo) speakers with Dolby sound processing. For anyone using this tablet for watching videos or listening to music, I thought that would be an important difference.What I found, as also mentioned elsewhere in this review and with respect to the sound quality, was that the limited volume ability of the built-in speakers makes ear pods or headphones or the use of an external speaker almost mandatory. If those considerations are acceptable, then the higher price of the 8 model is probably well worthwhile for users who will use the table very much to listen to music or videos.For reading Kindle books or those who prefer the smaller and lighter size, the 7” model is just great (either model is fine, really).By comparison, the latest small iPad mini has a 7.0” display and is roughly between the 7” and 8” Fire tablets in size (width and height), quite a bit thinner, and about the same weight as the 7” Fire. It’s considerably more powerful and has 128 GB storage standard, but think about it – you can purchase eight 7” Fire tablets for the price of a single iPad mini today! That is really a striking difference.FURTHER THOUGHTSThese two models are the 7th generation Amazon Fire tablet – the first generation was introduced in November, 2011 as the Kindle Fire, offering the same screen size and resolution but a considerably less powerful processor, and selling for $199. Along the way they’ve offered models of various sizes and specifications, and for a short time (generations 3 and 4) their Fire models included the more sophisticated (and expensive) Fire HDX model that may have been intended to be a more direct competitor to Apple’s iPad.Then, in September 2015, Amazon introduced the $49.99 Fire 7, and since that time it seems that they’ve been happy to offer these bargain priced tablets that do everything that most people really need on a day-to-day basis. They make great Kids tablets, too, particularly the ‘Kids Edition’ models that come with the more protective case and 2-year replacement guarantee, just in case your kid drops it in the, ah, swimming pool or some such!WARRANTYThe standard warranty for both Fire models is a short 90-days. Longer warranties - 1, 2 or 3 years - are available at extra cost ($10.99, $14.99, $16.99 respectively). Compared to most devices this is a very short standard warranty.CAMERA QUALITYBoth Fire models have a 2 MP rear-facing 'HD' camera, and a 'VGA' front-facing 0.3 MP camera. These are very mediocre cameras compared to just about any smart phone or tablet currently available and anyone wanting to take photos or videos with their tablet is not going to be satisfied with the quality that can be obtained from these Fire models, but they do suffice if all you want is to take a photo to make a visual note of something for future reference.INCLUDED ACCESSORIESBoth fire models include a 5W wall charger and a VERY SHORT USB cable (just over 3 ft long).As with pretty much all Amazon Fire and Kindle models these days, you can purchase either of these tablets either with or without ‘special offers’. The $15 difference in price eliminates the ads that show when the screen is locked (but disappear when unlocked).For anyone who wants a smaller and lighter weight tablet, these Fire models have become the logical choice. The prices are now so low that they can be a casual purchase for many people, not quite disposable but something easy to pass on when the next new model comes out.I will continue to add more details here as I use these tablets more and have thoughts and comments to share." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

We have a 2 story home and a finished basement.  Prior to googles mesh system I had to have two routers to get a decent signal throughout my home.  I tried extenders but they were worthless.  I had to have several wireless networks setup.  So you would have to switch networks if you wanted a decent signal in the basement.  Once I hooked up this system I had a strong signal from top to bottom of my house.  You will notice the difference in internet speeds in my picture once I switched over to google wifi (June 14).People have complained about loss of flexibity and tweaking since they have to use their phone to configure the google network.  I have no issues with doing anything I did prior to using this.  I work from home and connect to my employer via VPN with no issues.  I can view network traffic, turn off internet for the kids and see how many devices are connected at the click of a button on my phone.  No longing into the router from my desktop or my phones tiny browser.  When you walk from one level to the next, I can see which google router I am connected to.  It automatically switches to the closest one as advertised." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Compatible with Gig-Speed from Xfinity (CM1000-1AZNAS)" review="I upgraded my speed with my ISP to 1 Gbps but my old Arris modem wouldn't cut it. After doing some research and I narrowed down to Motorola and this Netgear CM1000. I've had several Netgear products before and they are all pretty reliable so I decided to give it a try. I managed to get close to 1 Gbps with this modem. When I did a raw wired test, I could hit the speed to around 980 Mbps consistently.This is what I did to make things work seemlessly.1. Do not unplug your old modem yet2. Take a picture of the MAC and Serial number of the CM1000 (should be on the box too)3. Sit the new CM 1000 next to your old modem then call your ISP (I use Comcast)4. Tell them that you need to replace your modem and have your model, MAC, and serial number (they don't ask sometimes) ready5. Once they input the MAC in their system, swap the modem, give it about 3 minutes to boot up then you're rock and rolling6. Keep your old modem for contingencyHope this review helps and if it does, please give me a thumb up." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Online trouble shooting is worthless, more info on youtube. Nice while it worked. Didn't use it all that much. Bought as a certified refurbished. Expected better than this. Glad I didn't get a brand new one. That would have really ticked me off. I now have a modern looking paper weight. Guess I'll look at other brands if I decide to replace this.Update: Amazon contacted me after this review and has replaced this for me even though it was out of warranty. Received replacement in 2 days and it appears to be functioning properly. Hats off to Amazon customer service for trying to make this right!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

LAN download speed through the router was a normal 27 to 30 Mb/sec.  The signal strength was excellent so we knew that wasn't the issue (and that wouldn't affect just the download speed anyway). We finally found the culprit!  The factory default setting for what is called Enable WMM (Wi-Fi multimedia) settings was enabled.  To disable this setting log into the router in the usual way  and click on Advanced > Setup > QoS Setup then uncheck the box next to Enable WMM (Wi-Fi multimedia) settings. NetGear should not have set this as a enabled by default or at least made the customer aware of this being a cause of extremely slow download speeds.We did not install Tomato firmware due to several forum complaints of this router getting bricked after installing Tomato but did upgrade the NetGear firmware to V1.2.0.32_40.0.74.So far its working great and produces very little heat which is a good thing for longevity of component life." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Once again, let me state that I know Microsoft puts out software with issues, etc, etc, etc, blah, blah, I chose to have a little faith in them.  Well, it is my opinion that the majority of the negative reviews are user error. After I read some of the success reviews, I pretty much confirmed my suspicions in that most were doing it wrong. You must use an active mini display port adaptor if you have older monitors. Following the suggestions of others I used the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EDSZYII?psc=1&redirect;=true&ref;_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00 adapters and works like a charm. I now have 3 monitors (the surface screen and two external monitors. I just simply connected them, went to my display settings and arranged them in the order I wanted them and that was that. The scaling is perfect, it simply just works. Again, I suspect that those with issues are using passive mini display adapters. Passive don't have the electronics built into the cord and the signal gets lost and compromised creating a failure.2/5/2016: update- still performing flawlessly." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet, 7" Display, 16 GB, Pink Kid-Proof Case" review="I am really sad to give this review anything less than 5 stars, but I would appreciate the understanding as to why. We have owned, now, 4 different Kids Edition Tablets. They have their pros and cons for sure, but we have started to notice a trend with each one. Before I get into why I am no longer a fan of these, I want to express my love for the content and set up.Pros: They have amazing options for kids, of all ages -- and an option to even set up a Kindle based on the age range. There is a huge variety of movies, shows, books, games, characters, etc. and that is great! There is no shortage of entertainment that these can't provide to children, as young at 24 months. We have found that our girls openly express the things they are learning, and we've watched their progress - which, as a parent, you wouldn't ask for much more! The battery life is also great so that helps keep kids entertained for hours, especially on a long car drive. Having the ability to expand the storage is great, and somewhat of a necessity as kids have a tendency to just click everything they see, downloading many gigs of data almost immediately. The case is also an added bonus. It does a great job of protecting the screen and for smaller kids, that's extremely important in extending the usage and life of your device. Kids can easily navigate the menus, parents can monitor the usage and set limits, and of course, the kids portion of the tablet is an add on so adults can use this tablet with ease whenever they choose to: with the ability to access the internet, social media, email, books, video apps, and everything else.Cons: There is only one major downside to these devices, but unfortunately we have seen the same thing happen with all 4 of the kids kindles we have had. The charger ports fail so quickly. The chargers are never secure, they wiggle after days of use and after about a month, the only way to successfully charge your device is through a stabilizer and tape. This method only seems to work out for so long before charging becomes an impossibility and you are back to returning your kindle. Thankfully they now have a 2 year return ability, but previously it was only 1 and we ended up with two non-charging kindles by the end of it. It has been the most disappointing part of having these and you can imagine our kids upset when they find out they no longer can play with their favorite tablet until we can get them, yet again, another one. Over time, the battery life also begins to suffer so I wish the batteries that were used for these items could hold a charge for a longer period of time. There comes a point, right around a year of having the device where a full battery may only last through a movie - we have given our daughter's their devices fully charged at 9am and they are dead, or close to dying, by no later than 11 or noon.These are my only two complaints, unfortunately they are pretty serious complaints and they affect the ability to use the items for as long as I believe you should be able to. If these issues were to be fixed, these would be the perfect kids electronic. Until then, I am definitely wary of purchasing any more of these devices." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I admit, I've only had it a short time, but this router is, by far, the biggest bang for the buck router I've ever owned. The router I replaced would give an anemic borderline 1 bar in our bedroom 2 floors up. I had to use an extender to get coverage everywhere in the house. When the main router went belly-up, I saw this one and was a little skeptical of the reviews... it sounded too good to be true. But I kid you not, I now have 3 bars up in the bedroom, and the poor little extender is going to atrophy due to non use! The range on this thing is absolutely, without question, the best I have ever seen. Set-up is a breeze, I was up and running less than 5 minutes after plugging it in to the cable modem. Would buy again, and encourage you to give it serious consideration if you need a good long range router without busting your wallet." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It was a KDS2600w (26 LCD). It was awesome and it still works perfectly.This monitor is a HUGE improvement over the KDS. It is not much larger but gosh darn, monitor quality has improved greatly during the past 10 years.Everything is beautiful. Photos, videos, and, games all look amazing. Granted, I updated my graphics card also but dang. It's like I went from 2008 to 2018. Which did actually happen.The gloss screen is the only reason I gave this a 4 star. I generally use my computer at night so it is not a big issue. It is an issue during daytime use. You could use this monitor as a mirror. There is a market of products to make a gloss screen matte. Products are available but they are expensive.OH! Also, this larger monitor uses less than half the power of my old monitor!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

With SB8200, approx 215Mbps/12Mbps with latency to Comcast speedtest site ~14ms, with 24+1 bonded channels down and 4 up.  Good overall SNR and power levels (which I had on the older modem also).Box is sealed from factory with with clear tape disc and black security seal sticker on bottom of box (see picture)Included in the box is 12VDC 2AMP power supply and CAT5 Ethernet cable (see picture)Size is approximately the same as the SB6121 (see picture - black SB6121 left, white SB8200 right)Unit tends to put off a little more heat than the SB6121 it replaced (warm to the touch on top of unit, but definitely not hot)Plugged SB8200 Ethernet (port 1) into computer Ethernet port via standard Cat5 cable, connected coax (Comcast), plugged in power supply. After about 45 seconds of no lights, lights started coming on, one-by-one. Opened browser, was redirected to Comcast activation page. Tried automatic activation with Comcast username and password and was greeted with error that I had to call Comcast.  Powered off modem and  decided I would try the process over again from the start. Instead of using username and password, used Comcast account # and SB8200 was provisioned very rapidly.Haven't tried SB8200 Ethernet port 2 as I don't have a need and I doubt that Comcast would allow residential customers to purchase static IP's without a business plan per their stated policies.Status page is located at the familiar 192.168.100.1 and Spectrum Analyzer is @ 192.168.100.1:8080 (u: admin p:password)Did I need the new SB8200? no.  Can I tell a difference in webpage load times? no  Is this futureproof? for now." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I figured over the last 5 years, I paid for at least six of them.After reading the details on EVERY approved and compatible unit that meets Comcast requirements I chose Motorola. I picked this model one because every 4 rating really was no different than the 5 rating and most of the 1 and 2 ratings were stupid responses. I didn't see the need to buy the top of the line so I chose this as it was closed to the top and was on sale for $50.00 off....great deal.I received it today, on a Sunday no less, as promised, called Comcast and gave them the S/N and the MAC. I just switch the coax cable, the 2 Ethernet cables, plugged in the power and voila! I was up and running in about 3-5 minutes after Comcast activated it.The most exciting thing is, everything is much faster with the new unit!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

This isn't a bad thing, because it also feels substantial, including the monitor hinge.  Many laptops in this price range feel like they need to be babied to survive long.  There is a physical Ethernet port, an HDMI port, three USB 3.0 ports, and up to date 802.11ac WiFi.  One nice touch is that the matte plastic has that brushed look, giving it a bit more traction and style.  More importantly, and unlike many modern laptops, it is easy to service or upgrade.PERFORMANCEThe 8th gen Core i3 2.2 Ghz CPU and 6 GB memory combine to give swift performance for most common tasks like word processing, web browsing in many tabs, and streaming video.  One shocking thing to me is how well it handled running its own 1080p screen, a second 1080p screen over USB 3.0, and a third 2560x1440 screen all at once without issue.  I was running multiple HD video streams and web browsing at the time on different screens.  My previous laptop that cost much more and had a dedicated GPU dropped a lot of frames in this configuration.I only notice the weaker CPU compared to my more expensive laptop with CPU intensive or heavy 3D tasks.  If you are running those, including things like gaming beyond the basics or rendering video, this may not be the right choice.  With that said, at this price, there is no great solution.I see another review talking about how slow the computer is, which makes me wonder if Windows was still installing updates.  Any new computer is going to be slow while all that happens in the background.  The network is being pushed, the hard drive is being run heavily, and the CPU is periodically busy.  The only thing noticeably slow is startup.  An SSD upgrade would speed things up substantially.SOFTWAREWhile I have to use Mac OS and Linux for work, Windows 10 is my favorite OS.  It is flexible and easy to work with, with the most support for hardware and usually no headaches installing new devices.  This version of Windows 10 is almost clean, but includes a few things that I would delete.  Namely, Norton Antivirus, which can cause issues and slowdown.  It is easy to delete and Windows 10 has an antivirus built in.DISPLAYIt is obvious where costs were cut to get the low price when you see the monitor in action.  It has a large bezel, which is not such a big deal.  However, the colors are washed out and even more washed out when not looking directly at it.  It is one of the worst screens I have seen in a long time, and the main reason for dropping my score.  It is passable, but I would personally spend a little more for a screen with better blacks and sharper details if I was going to do a lot of writing on it. While people rarely use laptops outside, the screen is also not bright enough for that.  As someone who usually cranks down the brightness to save my eyes, that aspect is fine with me.If you are going to be docking it and using standalone monitors, it supports higher resolutions well.INTERFACEThere is no touch screen, which I surprisingly miss because touch controls are so good in Windows 10.  But, they aren't critical.  The keyboard has nice travel and a proper full layout.  The trackpad isn't as responsive as a high end laptop and the clicks aren't as snappy, but it works properly and I haven't had to fight with it.BATTERYWow, the long battery life is so much better than my previous laptop, whichcould last through a movie and then be done for.  This is likely due to the newest Intel CPUs being built for low power consumption in combination with Acer's lack of concern over a big heavy battery.  The result is that, as long as I charge it at night, battery life just isn't a concern.  There is even a charging port for phones or tablets that is functional with the laptop off, making this a replacement for USB batteries.The charging itself could be improved, with a relatively large power brick.  I was hoping they allowed charging over USB, but I don't think that is available.  I could be missing how to do it.EDIT: I forgot to mention the bright blue light that stays on when it is charging and shut down.  It is very annoying to have it in my bedroom.  A bit of electrical tape fixes it, but I wish it wasn't there to begin with." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have always one for other options thinking that the Kindle Fire was not what I wanted. I was very,  very wrong.  This next generation of  tablets are amazing!It has about 12 hours battery life, it has  many settings that you can use to save your battery by going off Wifi if you don't need it. It is an 8 inch HD display,  it has a quad core processor, 1.3 gigahertz. It it has 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal storage, and a MicroSD slot for up to 256GB.  So you really have a lot of storage! It is so well made, I was surprised,  because  I have three other tablets which take forever to open. The Amazon Fire comes on instantly. You push the on button and it's on. It also contains 'Alexa',  which will be really helpful in accessing information and entertainment.  You can ask questions, play music,  check your calendar,  you can get news,  and weather,  and so much more.  Just press the home button and ask 'Alexa'.  You can enjoy hundreds of movies,  TV shows,  songs,  Kindle ebooks you can even have a text- to-speech narrator,  who will read the book to you! How AWESOME is that?  I can't say enough about this tablet.  I love it.  It has Netflix,  Facebook,  HBO and Spotify. Prime members get unlimited access to so many things at no additional cost. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!  It seems to have brought us into a different venue.  if not just a tablet anymore,  it now has Alexa and she'll show you how to navigate through this tablet. From one app to another just by speaking. It comes in a variety of colored covers. But this is not a tablet case.  If you want a tablet that is completely covered,  front and back,  you will have to buy a case separately. The case that comes with your Kindle Fire is just the back side of the case it does not cover the front. [...] Thank you for reading my review." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Nothing wrong with this hardware I give it 5 stars and I called customer support about an issue and rate it 10 out of 10. With that said let talk about issues I had.  I have comcast.. I know I know... Its the fastest I can get in my area. I first call comcast to get the MAC address added and after that I did a speed test and I normally got 120Mbps download and 10 Mpbs upload. After installing the modem I was getting 60Mbps download and 5Mbps upload. I called comcast and after BLAH BLAH everything (I am a network admin) I already did they said I have a 3rd party and its not a comcast modem, the modem in which its on there approval list. I called Arris and man the tech was so nice! They confirmed my it was my ISP issues. I called comcast again and asked to modem activation and let them know I need my modem re-provisioned. After that I went from and fake Onsite service call to proper internet speed. I was a 60Mbps down, 5Mbps up to............ 180Mbps down, 11Mbps up.When you buy this modem test your speed before and see what your paying for. If you have speed issues then its your ISP cheating you or bad activation programming.When you call your ISP you need to use key words as I have learned. They Are...Modem ActivationAndRe-provisioned" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I couldn't get the Smart WIFI Web Based Setup to work, then the router started to loop and then it would randomly reset/reboot on its own. Now, I am not a network tech or even in IT but I do know my way around most electronic devices. These symptoms that others had written about were the same that I was now experiencing with this brand new router. Heck, I couldn't even make it to the setup page to try and update the firmware because of the hardware resetting/rebooting every 10-45 seconds.Stepping back for just a moment, this reminded me of a 12v audio/computer installation that experienced similar problems/behavior. Our 12v in car PC would have instability and random reboots/random hardware failures. After many hours testing each component in the setup as well as checking each wire in the custom harness, a ROOKIE, yes a ROOKIE got his multimeter out and tested the source power (where the harness was hooked to the battery/distribution box) and the destination connections (where the harness lead into the car PC) and as it turns out, the voltage was below 10V, causing us to realize that we used the wrong gauge wire. We essentially used the bare minimum wire for the installation and whenever the in car PC would have a load on it (cold boot), the voltage would drop just enough to cause issues. We beefed up the power line considerably and all was well after that.Why the heck do I write a router review that includes a story about a 12v car PC? Cause the same problem is here:The Linksys label on the bottom of the router calls for a 12v 2a power supply. I checked the power supply that this NEW router came with and low and behold, the darn thing is rated for 12v 0.5a. This router will NEVER work properly without the correct power supply. I got a power supply from my LED strip parts bin that was rated for 12v 3.0a and plugged it in (same barrel connector). The router immediately came online, downloaded its updated firmware immediately and went online within 1 minute. I have only had this router for two hours since the power supply was corrected and I have had NO issues as of yet.To all of the folks that still have this router and are having any intermittent connectivity issues or having setup issues, check the power supply label and see if it is 12v 2.0a or higher. If it is not, replace it and hopefully that will solve your issues. Keep in mind that you may need to complete a factory reset with the new power supply and go through the setup process (as noted in the forums and manuals). If your router still is NOT working after correcting the power supply and redoing the factory reset & setup, then you may truly have a defective unit." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I function as a cybersecurity analyst and often need to connect many peripherals to my computer. Size vs available ports, this unit definitely outperforms the other type C hubs I have tried. Construction is also very solid; I like the metal body and overall feel/appearance of the unit.I only have issue with two areas for this particular hub.1: The passthrough charging capabilities do not actually work for me. I do not know if I received a bad unit in this regard or if my spectre utilizes voltages outside of the functional range. Either way, not a huge deal as I have two type C ports and never utilize this feature.2: The hub runs hot. Even for using it solely as a NIC. Temperatures never reached the point of causing problems but, at the same time, I would not like to have this in my lap while using it." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

We wanted to get a stronger signal from the router in my office to the great room and that side of the house.  The signal has about 85 feet to travel going outside across the deck and back in again, going through several walls in the process.  Before installing the extender in the great room, the strength of the signal from the router was very weak, -60 dBm (2.4g) and -67 dBm (5g); the speed of the signal was 21.5 mbps down and 6.6 mbps up (2.4g) and 40.4 mbps down and 4.96 mbps up (5g). With the extender, the strength of the signal has improved to -30 (2.4g) and -33 (5g), extremely strong, and the speed is consistently around 31 mbps down and 24.4 mbps up (2.4g) and 80 mbps both up and down (5g). A huge gain for the signal in both strength and speed for that side of the house!  The signal and speeds from the extender for both bands are very stable.  We're very pleased with this unit and have ordered another.One point I might add is that all the pictures show the 2 antennae with both straight up.  We get the best performance when we have one at about 45 degrees and the other about 90 degrees, so don't hesitate to move those and try different angles." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Fiberoptic digital cables, HDMI cables, component video cables, Lightning/USB cables, 30-pin cables, spools of phone and coax cable. You name it, I've got it. Bins full of the stuff. So I guess I'm a bit of a cable connoisseur. When the data/charging cable included with our Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 went bad from being abused (don't worry, the child responsible has been offered up for adoption), I came to Amazon to buy a replacement (cable, not child). This bulk packaged cable caught my eye, mostly due to the low price and other positive reviews.The cable arrived quickly, packaging was nothing special (you can't judge a book by its cover), but the cable itself is indistinguishable from the original that came with the tablet.  It's soft and pliable, yet at the same time supple and firm.  It forms a snug, secure connection on both the USB and 30-pin end, and works perfectly for charging and for data transfer.  In short, a great cable at a nice price.  Excuse me while I explain to the new children how to properly treat a cable.UPDATE (4/14): one year later, this cable is still going strong (and so are the new children). I should mention that my cable was fulfilled by Amazon from a seller called HK Seller. If people are getting lower quality knock-offs, this may be due to some third party sellers selling inferior/imitation goods. Be careful who you buy it from!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Surround Sound is very nice (requires use of included USB sound card) and really ups the immersion on games that support the surround sound.  Microphone Quality is on par however for most programs you will need to have the microphone volume set in the operating system at 98 - 100 percent (much lower than that and voice detection starts falling off for most chat programs).  Cord is long (VERY long) and has a Velcro strap for management. Inline volume adjustment and mute switch are a major plus!CONS:Aside from having to mute the microphone feedback in the Playback Devices settings the only real negative thing I have to say about these is the quality of construction. The piece just about where the cups attach to the headband is notorious for cracking. Once it cracks it's only a matter of time before the whole plastic plate is falling off and you are either contacting warranty or buying a new pair. I have had to replace mine once already through warranty and my new pair is already cracking. I owned the first pair for 6 months before they broke fully and the new pair not even 2 months and it's already cracked. I'm not a violent gamer so I don't throw my headset around. I even hang it carefully on the side of my desk where it's safely stored when not in use. I'm believe it is simply due to how wide my head is. The headband itself doesn't adjust to accommodate wider heads while the ear cups are adjustable to accommodate people with taller heads which I feel is where the flaw is in the design. In the attached images you can see where it broke and where it cracks. This stress point is most certainly caused by the poor construction at the joint." data-balloon="See users review on this product."
