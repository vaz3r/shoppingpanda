Online trouble shooting is worthless, more info on youtube. Nice while it worked. Didn't use it all that much. Bought as a certified refurbished. Expected better than this. Glad I didn't get a brand new one. That would have really ticked me off. I now have a modern looking paper weight. Guess I'll look at other brands if I decide to replace this.Update: Amazon contacted me after this review and has replaced this for me even though it was out of warranty. Received replacement in 2 days and it appears to be functioning properly. Hats off to Amazon customer service for trying to make this right!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa, 7" Display, 8 GB, Black - with Special Offers" review=" Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. It’s still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and it’s such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7” model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7” 8 or 16 GB; 8” 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8” model is $10 cheaper--- the 7” model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7” model). Note that the Kids edition is only sold with the higher storage (7” – 16 GB; 8” – 32 GB)--- both models can use up to 256 GB microSDXC expansion storage (previously max 128 GB for 7”)--- both models offer Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant at the touch of a button--- both models are physically the same size as previously but slightly lighter – the 8” has lost 1 oz of weight, the 7” is 0.6 oz lighter- BOTH 7” and 8” MODELS are suitable for:--- web surfing using Amazon’s Silk browser--- watching streaming movies or TV shows **--- listening to music **--- reading Kindle books (the 7” is roughly the same size as a Kindle)--- playing games and other apps (within the limitation of Amazon's own ecosystem)--- Kid use – both offer the ability to set up child accounts with restricted access--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- IN ADDITION, THE 8” FIRE HAS:--- slightly larger and higher quality display (but I found both displays to be essentially equivalent in quality)--- larger standard storage (16 GB vs 8 GB)--- better sound – Dolby audio, stereo (7” has mono speaker) **--- larger battery / longer life between charges (Amazon states up to 12 hours, vs up to 8 hrs for the 7”)--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- WHAT DON’T THEY DO AND WHAT ARE THEIR LIMITATIONS?--- Neither model will display 1080p video--- camera specs are poor compared to most current phone and higher priced tablets, so don’t expect high resolution photos--- Sound quality and volume ability is a limitation - see next paragraph--- With limited built in storage, they both rely upon the expansion slot to store larger amounts of photos, videos, or music. Responsiveness using memory from the expansion slot is not quite the same as with a tablet that has greater hard wired storage built-in--- All Fire models are limited to using Amazon’s own Silk web browser, which is less flexible than the regular Chrome or Firefox browsers that can be used on regular Android or Apple tablets- THE SOUND QUALITY AND MAXIMUM VOLUME CAPABILITY IS A WEAK POINT--- Accepting the fact that these are very low cost tablets, they do offer the ability to listen to videos and music and so the built-in speakers will be relied upon by many users. In my opinion the most significant difference between these two Fire models, aside from the screen size, is the difference in sound quality. But I first want to say that neither model has the ability to provide much volume of sound, even at the very highest setting. This is a disappointment.--- The 7 Fire has a single speaker located on the rear of the device, near the bottom. It is weak and produces a very low quality sound. Also, depending on how you are holding the tablet, or if you're using a case to hold it in landscape or portrait mode, the speaker could be covered and even further muffled.--- The 8 HD Fire has better quality sound - two stereo speakers located on the side, positioned so that they will be at the top when the tablet is supported in landscape mode. It also has better sound processing ('Dolby Atmos'), and the sound quality is noticeably better than the 7. Still, the maximum volume capability is modest.--- Bottom line - if you plan to use either model for listening to music or videos, then ear pods or headphones or an external speaker is probably going to be necessary in order to get satisfactory sound. Sound quality is not going to be something owners of these small Fire tablets will be bragging about.- MY IMPRESSIONS OF BOTH MODELS AND HOW THEY COMPAREI purchased both models and illustrate them side by side in my video. They’re obviously very similar in feel and appearance, and the quality is excellent. I also like the matching Amazon cases that protect the screen when not in use and prop the tablet in either landscape or portrait orientation to make it easy to set it on a table to read or watch videos. The cases work exactly the same for both sizes.The display is the most obvious difference – not only size, but the slightly greater display content and resolution. At least that is what the Amazon specs suggest, but to my eyes they are both pretty much the same. I did find that the 7 model seemed to have a slightly brighter display, and the 'whiteness' of the display also seemed to be better.The other difference I wanted to evaluate was the sound quality, since the 7 model has only a single speaker and the 8 model has two (stereo) speakers with Dolby sound processing. For anyone using this tablet for watching videos or listening to music, I thought that would be an important difference.What I found, as also mentioned elsewhere in this review and with respect to the sound quality, was that the limited volume ability of the built-in speakers makes ear pods or headphones or the use of an external speaker almost mandatory. If those considerations are acceptable, then the higher price of the 8 model is probably well worthwhile for users who will use the table very much to listen to music or videos.For reading Kindle books or those who prefer the smaller and lighter size, the 7” model is just great (either model is fine, really).By comparison, the latest small iPad mini has a 7.0” display and is roughly between the 7” and 8” Fire tablets in size (width and height), quite a bit thinner, and about the same weight as the 7” Fire. It’s considerably more powerful and has 128 GB storage standard, but think about it – you can purchase eight 7” Fire tablets for the price of a single iPad mini today! That is really a striking difference.FURTHER THOUGHTSThese two models are the 7th generation Amazon Fire tablet – the first generation was introduced in November, 2011 as the Kindle Fire, offering the same screen size and resolution but a considerably less powerful processor, and selling for $199. Along the way they’ve offered models of various sizes and specifications, and for a short time (generations 3 and 4) their Fire models included the more sophisticated (and expensive) Fire HDX model that may have been intended to be a more direct competitor to Apple’s iPad.Then, in September 2015, Amazon introduced the $49.99 Fire 7, and since that time it seems that they’ve been happy to offer these bargain priced tablets that do everything that most people really need on a day-to-day basis. They make great Kids tablets, too, particularly the ‘Kids Edition’ models that come with the more protective case and 2-year replacement guarantee, just in case your kid drops it in the, ah, swimming pool or some such!WARRANTYThe standard warranty for both Fire models is a short 90-days. Longer warranties - 1, 2 or 3 years - are available at extra cost ($10.99, $14.99, $16.99 respectively). Compared to most devices this is a very short standard warranty.CAMERA QUALITYBoth Fire models have a 2 MP rear-facing 'HD' camera, and a 'VGA' front-facing 0.3 MP camera. These are very mediocre cameras compared to just about any smart phone or tablet currently available and anyone wanting to take photos or videos with their tablet is not going to be satisfied with the quality that can be obtained from these Fire models, but they do suffice if all you want is to take a photo to make a visual note of something for future reference.INCLUDED ACCESSORIESBoth fire models include a 5W wall charger and a VERY SHORT USB cable (just over 3 ft long).As with pretty much all Amazon Fire and Kindle models these days, you can purchase either of these tablets either with or without ‘special offers’. The $15 difference in price eliminates the ads that show when the screen is locked (but disappear when unlocked).For anyone who wants a smaller and lighter weight tablet, these Fire models have become the logical choice. The prices are now so low that they can be a casual purchase for many people, not quite disposable but something easy to pass on when the next new model comes out.I will continue to add more details here as I use these tablets more and have thoughts and comments to share." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

There are 4 important points I'd like to make:1) All these years I paid for a 50mbps speed from my cable company. I had an older Netgear from 2009 which has served me well all these years (and still works) but I decided it was time to upgrade. Typically I was getting only 12-17mbps through my wi-fi (for example, to my iPhone6). After getting this Nighthawk Router, I now get 57mbps on the same iPhone. All of my devices are much faster now... PS4, iPhones, iPads, Epson Printer, Baby Monitor, Tablets, Roku 3 box, Roku Streaming Stick, etc...2) Cables .... Please note, one other thing I did in addition to getting this router is that I also bought all new cat6 cables (from Amazon Basics), and that has helped the router to connect well to the cable modem. From the router itself, I have a few wired items (Roku 3 box, PS4, my PC). And note that I tested the Roku 3 box, PS4, and PC wirelessly as well. In all conditions, wired with Cat6 cables and/or wi-fi, this Nighthawk router has delivered the speeds I was missing for years.3) Interface.... Also, I like the interface for setting up and using the router. I like that you get two options of 2.4ghz or 5ghz connection. One thing to keep in mind is that some older devices can only use 2.4g so it is that old device itself that limits the connection speed (not your wi-fi necessarily). Newer devices are 5g capable and can maximize the speed capability.4) Security... I also like the Access Control feature so that you have to permit a device to connect to your wi-fi. For example, when I got a new iPad this Christmas, I logged into my wi-fi network and put in the proper password, but it wouldn't connect to the internet. Then I went to the Netgear interface on my PC and it displayed that the iPad had been blocked (because Access Control is turned on). So then I simply hit a check box to allow the iPad onto my home network, and then it connected.Finally, I am not a tech person, I just try to read up on things to the best of my ability. I hope my review helps some of you.5 STARS" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have always one for other options thinking that the Kindle Fire was not what I wanted. I was very,  very wrong.  This next generation of  tablets are amazing!It has about 12 hours battery life, it has  many settings that you can use to save your battery by going off Wifi if you don't need it. It is an 8 inch HD display,  it has a quad core processor, 1.3 gigahertz. It it has 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal storage, and a MicroSD slot for up to 256GB.  So you really have a lot of storage! It is so well made, I was surprised,  because  I have three other tablets which take forever to open. The Amazon Fire comes on instantly. You push the on button and it's on. It also contains 'Alexa',  which will be really helpful in accessing information and entertainment.  You can ask questions, play music,  check your calendar,  you can get news,  and weather,  and so much more.  Just press the home button and ask 'Alexa'.  You can enjoy hundreds of movies,  TV shows,  songs,  Kindle ebooks you can even have a text- to-speech narrator,  who will read the book to you! How AWESOME is that?  I can't say enough about this tablet.  I love it.  It has Netflix,  Facebook,  HBO and Spotify. Prime members get unlimited access to so many things at no additional cost. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!  It seems to have brought us into a different venue.  if not just a tablet anymore,  it now has Alexa and she'll show you how to navigate through this tablet. From one app to another just by speaking. It comes in a variety of colored covers. But this is not a tablet case.  If you want a tablet that is completely covered,  front and back,  you will have to buy a case separately. The case that comes with your Kindle Fire is just the back side of the case it does not cover the front. [...] Thank you for reading my review." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

We have a 2 story home and a finished basement.  Prior to googles mesh system I had to have two routers to get a decent signal throughout my home.  I tried extenders but they were worthless.  I had to have several wireless networks setup.  So you would have to switch networks if you wanted a decent signal in the basement.  Once I hooked up this system I had a strong signal from top to bottom of my house.  You will notice the difference in internet speeds in my picture once I switched over to google wifi (June 14).People have complained about loss of flexibity and tweaking since they have to use their phone to configure the google network.  I have no issues with doing anything I did prior to using this.  I work from home and connect to my employer via VPN with no issues.  I can view network traffic, turn off internet for the kids and see how many devices are connected at the click of a button on my phone.  No longing into the router from my desktop or my phones tiny browser.  When you walk from one level to the next, I can see which google router I am connected to.  It automatically switches to the closest one as advertised." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Anker delivers  AGAIN!The color means you'll never reach for the wrong cable again in your confusing mass of black and white cables. The braiding ensures that it doesn't get tangled or maimed. 6 feet means you can comfortably charge and use it at the same time, although it charges so fast, this is just an added bonus. But if you have an outlet across the room, the extra feet are the difference between frustration and easy breezy CoverGirl.Plus, I can can be confident that should anything happen to these cords, or if I have any problems whatsoever at any point, Anker will be there in a heartbeat to fix it or replace it, graciously and hassle-free.I bought Anker Chargers, Anker speakers, Anker batteries, I just wish they made cars...If you're looking for a tech product and Anker makes it, go Anker;.  you can't go wrong. I don't write many reviews because I expect to get a decent product for a decent price, but I write reviews when I get an extraordinary product for a decent price, backed by a true guarantee, THEN I write a review." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Since the price difference between a 128gb SD and a 256gb SD is about $100, I went with the 128. I use this away from home since it is a lot smaller and lighter than my laptops. This is a lot better than using your cell phone1. The customer service both phone and chat is outstanding.2. The Alexa set up is better than it is on the Generation 5.3. I would suggest that you go to “Settings” and the “Help”. An excellent manual is available in “Help”.4. If you are new to the Fire HD 10, Take your time picking out your aps and delete the one that didn’t work out the way you want.5. The screen size is fine and very clear.6. If you have Alexa play music while you work on something on the Fire, you will find that the battery charge will drop faster. For you senior citizens, I am 83 years old and have no trouble using this unit." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I've only stuck to those that were packed in with my consoles (cheap, I know.) The high prices of Turtle beaches and the like always turned me off of purchasing one. That was until I saw these. 27.99? Can't go wrong with that. Most would assume that the cheaper the price, the cheaper the quality... Well thats the exact opposite with these.First off these are comfortable as hell. They fit perfectly over my ears, cutting off 90% of the sounds around me and they just feel so good around my ears.They don't feel sore after long sessions either.The audio quality is perfect. Whether its a youtube video or the sounds of war in Battlefield 1, everything sounds crystal clear. Most importantly the bass is booming! The volume control is easy to use and percise.As a added bonus it comes with multiple adapters for other consoles and the like. These headsets are compatible with Xbox one, Ps4, Switch and gaming PCs.I could not be happier with this headset. Comfortable, precise and high quality. What more could you ask for? Especially for the price. Great Product!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

There's some golden nuggets here that you need to know.When I first upgraded to the new gigabit here in Denver (from Xfinity), it was using their new Cable Modem/Router device (XB6-A) and I was only getting 500 Mbps download speed. It was also lagging in our house when several people were gaming and others were downloading, or even accessing intensive web-pages. (lagging = pings were going up).Since upgrading to this Netgear CM1000, upgrading my cabling, and factory resetting my router, I'm now getting the most download throughput (~941 Mbps) and the lowest pings I've EVER seen! Connection is rock solid throughout the house.SHORT ANSWER: Get this Netgear CM, upgrade your ethernet cables to Cat 6 (or Cat 5E for short distances) and then Factory Reset your router to get the most speed. You still may need a new router to reach gigabit speeds. I'm getting the most download throughput (~941 Mbps) and the lowest pings I've EVER seen!I did lots of tests comparing this cable modem to the XB6-A that Xfinity provided. Here are some big things I learned:1) Make sure your ethernet cables going from the cable modem to the router and from the router to your PC are CAT6 or at least CAT5E (for short distances).2) Upgrading to this Netgear CM1000 Cable Modem LOWERED my ping/latency compared to the XB6-A that Xfinity provided. I just got a 5 MS Ping to the google server here in Denver! UNHEARD OF. Most of the time it's around 8-9ms with this new cable modem.  I was getting 11-14 w/ the Xfinity modem. If you're a gamer, a lower ping matters!3) The Xfinity XB6-A modem/router combo doesn't work too well when you have your own router also connected to it.  Xfinity recommends you only use their device and disconnect your router.4) Around 941 mbps is the max download speed that modern gigabit routers/switches can do right now so don't be worried if you can't get above that.5) Many routers can't handle gigabit download speeds, especially if you've enabled any of the features like QoS, Traffic Meter, Keyword block, etc. My Netgear Nighthawk (R7000) was only getting 400-500 mbps (using speedtest) because I had enabled some of these features.  Even when I disabled these features, the speed was still low. Doing a FACTORY reset fixed it, and now I'm getting 937 - 943 mbps download speed!!!The reason these routers slow down when you enable extra features is because it disables CTF (cut through forwarding) and the router no longer uses it's faster processor. Some of the newer routers can still maintain max download speeds of 941 mbps while also allowing you to use QoS and other features.6) There's a great website called Small Net Builder that compared routers to see which could reach 941 mbps download speed. I recommend you check that out if you need a new router.Keep in mind that this Netgear CM1000 is JUST a cable modem. It's not a router. So if you only have 1 device you want to wire into it, you're fine but if you want to have more devices, and wireless, then you'll need a router too.The Xfinity provided XB6-A is both a cable modem and a wireless router in one. I personally think it has some flaws that need to be worked out but appears to be a beefy piece of hardware. You can save yourself the $10/month rental by getting this Netgear CM1000.P.S. I do plan to upgrade my router so that I can still get 941 mbps download speed while enabling QoS. With QoS, it will set aside a portion of your bandwidth (say 20%) for high priority traffic like gaming that need low latency, and then it will limit all other connections (like large downloads) to the other 80% the connection. Keep in mind, if you enable this and run a speedtest, it will appear lower simply because it's now reserving part of your bandwidth for other devices/traffic in your home." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="HP Pavilion 21.5-Inch IPS LED HDMI VGA Monitor" review="Great value for the price. It is quite helpful that you can switch between the VGA and HDMI inputs using either software or the second button on the front right underside next to the power button. This monitor has very good contrast of darks and lights, easy to set up (angle it before attaching the cables), and has roughly a 60 degree viewing angle (30 degrees on either side of dead center) in which the picture remains sharp and clear, so people sitting off center or next to the main user will still see a crisp accurate picture. It's very light but also very stable.UPDATE: Not good value. It has been 2 months since purchase. The screen now produces stray dark lines from top to bottom. It is not the cable connection. If you pinch the black plastic frame around the screen glass just below the dark line, the dark line disappears temporarily until you stop pinching below it. Unfortunate that this monitor didn't last beyond 2 months of limited use. No longer consider this a good value at all.2ND UPDATE: manufacturer wants credit card info (through chat) to replace the defective monitor still under warranty - instead of providing means to ship it back (like a shipping label so you know you aren't getting charged hidden fees) before getting the replacement. It reads too much like a cc scam so not worth it." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

We are Apple users, everything in my house and office are Apple but seriously when I went to the Apple store Ro buy an iPad  I just felt it was sooo much money for a gadget that my kids throw everywhere, sit on top, etc...so I decided to do some research and found the Amazon Fire 8 kids version to be an interesting option. For the price of one iPad mini I could get 2 Fire HD8 and still save money, so I was like “I’ll try”. Seriously, as soon as I started setting it up I love how everything was so easy and how they separate the content that will be displayed to each kid based on age. A lot of free games, tv shows and movies and the best are the Disney ones, my kids love Disney. The content is free for the first year and then you pay $2.99 per month (the price of one single app on the Apple store)On WiFi, you get the whole set of free shows and stuff and for on the go stuff, I downloaded a bunch of tv shows and games for free with my prime membership.My kids would ask for new games all the time for their iPad and now they couldn’t believe their eyes when they saw all that selection available for them.I definitely recommend this product!!!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="HP 23.8-inch FHD IPS Monitor with Tilt/Height Adjustment and Built-in Speakers (VH240a, Black)" review="This laptop sits at just over 4 stars while some of the other similarly priced and comparable monitors from Spectre, Lenovo, and other brands hover around 4.5 stars. This gave me pause, but after looking through many of the 1-3 star reviews it was clear that the majority had harshly penalized the monitor due to its reportedly lackluster audio performance. My laptop has surprisingly decent sound so I could essentially care less about the monitor's speakers. Now if my laptop didn't sound good then I would have simply connected my laptop to my Bluetooth speaker, my old PC speakers, my blue tooth headphones, or hell even my surround sound if I felt so inclined. Those reviews are overly demanding imo.First Impression: Time spent from opening the box to having the monitor up and running was under 5 minutes. Well designed packaging and easy to put together - no screwdriver required. Came with both a HDMI and an Aux cord... ok cool I appreciate that but whatever. First glance of the monitor on my 38 x 24 desk and I'm satisfied with its footprint. The screen bezels are tiny which looks good and helps manage size. Another plus is how the base extends behind the screen as opposed to extruding in front which would take up valuable real estate in front of the monitor. The monitor and my laptop share the desk very well, and there is even generous room for an open notebook directly in front of the monitor. I'm glad that I went with a 23.8 monitor over something like a 20-22 as that last 1-3 inches makes a noticeable difference in screen size. The design and style of the product is very sleek and it looks great on my desk. It definitely doesn't advertise its modest price tag with its expensive and luxury appearance.Early performance: When I connected my laptop (a lightly upgraded Lenovo T440P Thinkpad, maybe a $400 laptop) via HDMI to the monitor I was  met with a large snowy-owl staring at me (one of the photos that Windows cycles through before/during log-in). The picture was bright, edges were sharp, and the snow-white feathers of the owl looked like a true pure white. The contrast between the white of the owl, its dark eyes and the brown of the tree was great and everything looked realistic and accurate. After logging in I went into the Windows display settings and made a few simple adjustments on how I wanted the laptop to display to the monitor, it was very easy and intuitive to do.First thing I did was browse some HD Youtube videos (a Lord of the Rings fight scene, and Planet Earth) and I was immediately impressed. The screen kept up with the intense action/pace of the LotR fight without any lagging frames or stuttering. Planet Earth's tropical videos looked bright and accurately colorful while the following cave video was properly dark and intense with moments of brightness. Here the speed of some of the small critters gave the monitor a little bit of blurring, especially when the color of the animal was similar to the color of the background. I then switched over to Netflix, browsed a bit, and decided on Planet Earth again since the show has so many amazing spectacles to view. Everything looked just as great and in some cases even a little bit better. The speed of the animals didn't seem to blur as with youtube (note: I didn't watch the exact same video so this is highly anecdotal.) When it came to reading text and more general browsing of the web I was pleased. Letters had sharp corners, and the additional amount of text that fits on the screen vs my 14 laptop made for less scrolling.Happy with the video playback I rotated the monitor (set monitor to top height, grasp edges of screen, and twist it to the right) to portrait. The rotation felt smooth and solid. Boy does it make for a long screen, but I'm confident I will use it when working with long lists of data, programming, using Excel, etc. I am glad I will have the option.Weaknesses: As mentioned before the sound is definitely weak. The volume is low, audio sounds pretty shallow, and there just isn't much to report there. In my mostly quiet apartment I could hear and understand the audio from the monitor, but it admittedly wasn't long before I reverted back to my laptop sound. Nonetheless having an at least usable audio option as a back-up is better than nothing. I will generally award more points to any item that exceeds the expectations of its main function than I will penalize a product for including an average to below-average extra that is not vital to performance. If my computer chair gave me a back massage I would be very pleasantly surprised, but if it had a lumpy seat, didn't spin smoothly, and was stuck at a certain height I wouldn't be so pleased. I'll choose the chair that I can be comfortable in for hours, spins effortlessly and noiselessly, and adjusts height easily.I can't speak to using the monitor for gaming and whether it can handle that demand as I don't have the gaming tech knowledge, the gaming experience, or even a game to test it with.Final Pros: Sleek aesthetic/design, stand rotates landscape-to-portrait, tiny bezels, good brightness, dark blacks, efficient footprint, simple and  smooth tilt/height adjustmentsFinal Cons: Weak speakers, minor blurring at times of very fast moving video.I highly recommend it!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa, 7" Display, 8 GB, Marine Blue - with Special Offers" review=" Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. It’s still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and it’s such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7” model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7” 8 or 16 GB; 8” 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8” model is $10 cheaper--- the 7” model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7” model). Note that the Kids edition is only sold with the higher storage (7” – 16 GB; 8” – 32 GB)--- both models can use up to 256 GB microSDXC expansion storage (previously max 128 GB for 7”)--- both models offer Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant at the touch of a button--- both models are physically the same size as previously but slightly lighter – the 8” has lost 1 oz of weight, the 7” is 0.6 oz lighter- BOTH 7” and 8” MODELS are suitable for:--- web surfing using Amazon’s Silk browser--- watching streaming movies or TV shows **--- listening to music **--- reading Kindle books (the 7” is roughly the same size as a Kindle)--- playing games and other apps (within the limitation of Amazon's own ecosystem)--- Kid use – both offer the ability to set up child accounts with restricted access--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- IN ADDITION, THE 8” FIRE HAS:--- slightly larger and higher quality display (but I found both displays to be essentially equivalent in quality)--- larger standard storage (16 GB vs 8 GB)--- better sound – Dolby audio, stereo (7” has mono speaker) **--- larger battery / longer life between charges (Amazon states up to 12 hours, vs up to 8 hrs for the 7”)--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- WHAT DON’T THEY DO AND WHAT ARE THEIR LIMITATIONS?--- Neither model will display 1080p video--- camera specs are poor compared to most current phone and higher priced tablets, so don’t expect high resolution photos--- Sound quality and volume ability is a limitation - see next paragraph--- With limited built in storage, they both rely upon the expansion slot to store larger amounts of photos, videos, or music. Responsiveness using memory from the expansion slot is not quite the same as with a tablet that has greater hard wired storage built-in--- All Fire models are limited to using Amazon’s own Silk web browser, which is less flexible than the regular Chrome or Firefox browsers that can be used on regular Android or Apple tablets- THE SOUND QUALITY AND MAXIMUM VOLUME CAPABILITY IS A WEAK POINT--- Accepting the fact that these are very low cost tablets, they do offer the ability to listen to videos and music and so the built-in speakers will be relied upon by many users. In my opinion the most significant difference between these two Fire models, aside from the screen size, is the difference in sound quality. But I first want to say that neither model has the ability to provide much volume of sound, even at the very highest setting. This is a disappointment.--- The 7 Fire has a single speaker located on the rear of the device, near the bottom. It is weak and produces a very low quality sound. Also, depending on how you are holding the tablet, or if you're using a case to hold it in landscape or portrait mode, the speaker could be covered and even further muffled.--- The 8 HD Fire has better quality sound - two stereo speakers located on the side, positioned so that they will be at the top when the tablet is supported in landscape mode. It also has better sound processing ('Dolby Atmos'), and the sound quality is noticeably better than the 7. Still, the maximum volume capability is modest.--- Bottom line - if you plan to use either model for listening to music or videos, then ear pods or headphones or an external speaker is probably going to be necessary in order to get satisfactory sound. Sound quality is not going to be something owners of these small Fire tablets will be bragging about.- MY IMPRESSIONS OF BOTH MODELS AND HOW THEY COMPAREI purchased both models and illustrate them side by side in my video. They’re obviously very similar in feel and appearance, and the quality is excellent. I also like the matching Amazon cases that protect the screen when not in use and prop the tablet in either landscape or portrait orientation to make it easy to set it on a table to read or watch videos. The cases work exactly the same for both sizes.The display is the most obvious difference – not only size, but the slightly greater display content and resolution. At least that is what the Amazon specs suggest, but to my eyes they are both pretty much the same. I did find that the 7 model seemed to have a slightly brighter display, and the 'whiteness' of the display also seemed to be better.The other difference I wanted to evaluate was the sound quality, since the 7 model has only a single speaker and the 8 model has two (stereo) speakers with Dolby sound processing. For anyone using this tablet for watching videos or listening to music, I thought that would be an important difference.What I found, as also mentioned elsewhere in this review and with respect to the sound quality, was that the limited volume ability of the built-in speakers makes ear pods or headphones or the use of an external speaker almost mandatory. If those considerations are acceptable, then the higher price of the 8 model is probably well worthwhile for users who will use the table very much to listen to music or videos.For reading Kindle books or those who prefer the smaller and lighter size, the 7” model is just great (either model is fine, really).By comparison, the latest small iPad mini has a 7.0” display and is roughly between the 7” and 8” Fire tablets in size (width and height), quite a bit thinner, and about the same weight as the 7” Fire. It’s considerably more powerful and has 128 GB storage standard, but think about it – you can purchase eight 7” Fire tablets for the price of a single iPad mini today! That is really a striking difference.FURTHER THOUGHTSThese two models are the 7th generation Amazon Fire tablet – the first generation was introduced in November, 2011 as the Kindle Fire, offering the same screen size and resolution but a considerably less powerful processor, and selling for $199. Along the way they’ve offered models of various sizes and specifications, and for a short time (generations 3 and 4) their Fire models included the more sophisticated (and expensive) Fire HDX model that may have been intended to be a more direct competitor to Apple’s iPad.Then, in September 2015, Amazon introduced the $49.99 Fire 7, and since that time it seems that they’ve been happy to offer these bargain priced tablets that do everything that most people really need on a day-to-day basis. They make great Kids tablets, too, particularly the ‘Kids Edition’ models that come with the more protective case and 2-year replacement guarantee, just in case your kid drops it in the, ah, swimming pool or some such!WARRANTYThe standard warranty for both Fire models is a short 90-days. Longer warranties - 1, 2 or 3 years - are available at extra cost ($10.99, $14.99, $16.99 respectively). Compared to most devices this is a very short standard warranty.CAMERA QUALITYBoth Fire models have a 2 MP rear-facing 'HD' camera, and a 'VGA' front-facing 0.3 MP camera. These are very mediocre cameras compared to just about any smart phone or tablet currently available and anyone wanting to take photos or videos with their tablet is not going to be satisfied with the quality that can be obtained from these Fire models, but they do suffice if all you want is to take a photo to make a visual note of something for future reference.INCLUDED ACCESSORIESBoth fire models include a 5W wall charger and a VERY SHORT USB cable (just over 3 ft long).As with pretty much all Amazon Fire and Kindle models these days, you can purchase either of these tablets either with or without ‘special offers’. The $15 difference in price eliminates the ads that show when the screen is locked (but disappear when unlocked).For anyone who wants a smaller and lighter weight tablet, these Fire models have become the logical choice. The prices are now so low that they can be a casual purchase for many people, not quite disposable but something easy to pass on when the next new model comes out.I will continue to add more details here as I use these tablets more and have thoughts and comments to share." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa, 7" Display, 8 GB, Punch Red - with Special Offers" review=" Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. It’s still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and it’s such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7” model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7” 8 or 16 GB; 8” 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8” model is $10 cheaper--- the 7” model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7” model). Note that the Kids edition is only sold with the higher storage (7” – 16 GB; 8” – 32 GB)--- both models can use up to 256 GB microSDXC expansion storage (previously max 128 GB for 7”)--- both models offer Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant at the touch of a button--- both models are physically the same size as previously but slightly lighter – the 8” has lost 1 oz of weight, the 7” is 0.6 oz lighter- BOTH 7” and 8” MODELS are suitable for:--- web surfing using Amazon’s Silk browser--- watching streaming movies or TV shows **--- listening to music **--- reading Kindle books (the 7” is roughly the same size as a Kindle)--- playing games and other apps (within the limitation of Amazon's own ecosystem)--- Kid use – both offer the ability to set up child accounts with restricted access--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- IN ADDITION, THE 8” FIRE HAS:--- slightly larger and higher quality display (but I found both displays to be essentially equivalent in quality)--- larger standard storage (16 GB vs 8 GB)--- better sound – Dolby audio, stereo (7” has mono speaker) **--- larger battery / longer life between charges (Amazon states up to 12 hours, vs up to 8 hrs for the 7”)--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- WHAT DON’T THEY DO AND WHAT ARE THEIR LIMITATIONS?--- Neither model will display 1080p video--- camera specs are poor compared to most current phone and higher priced tablets, so don’t expect high resolution photos--- Sound quality and volume ability is a limitation - see next paragraph--- With limited built in storage, they both rely upon the expansion slot to store larger amounts of photos, videos, or music. Responsiveness using memory from the expansion slot is not quite the same as with a tablet that has greater hard wired storage built-in--- All Fire models are limited to using Amazon’s own Silk web browser, which is less flexible than the regular Chrome or Firefox browsers that can be used on regular Android or Apple tablets- THE SOUND QUALITY AND MAXIMUM VOLUME CAPABILITY IS A WEAK POINT--- Accepting the fact that these are very low cost tablets, they do offer the ability to listen to videos and music and so the built-in speakers will be relied upon by many users. In my opinion the most significant difference between these two Fire models, aside from the screen size, is the difference in sound quality. But I first want to say that neither model has the ability to provide much volume of sound, even at the very highest setting. This is a disappointment.--- The 7 Fire has a single speaker located on the rear of the device, near the bottom. It is weak and produces a very low quality sound. Also, depending on how you are holding the tablet, or if you're using a case to hold it in landscape or portrait mode, the speaker could be covered and even further muffled.--- The 8 HD Fire has better quality sound - two stereo speakers located on the side, positioned so that they will be at the top when the tablet is supported in landscape mode. It also has better sound processing ('Dolby Atmos'), and the sound quality is noticeably better than the 7. Still, the maximum volume capability is modest.--- Bottom line - if you plan to use either model for listening to music or videos, then ear pods or headphones or an external speaker is probably going to be necessary in order to get satisfactory sound. Sound quality is not going to be something owners of these small Fire tablets will be bragging about.- MY IMPRESSIONS OF BOTH MODELS AND HOW THEY COMPAREI purchased both models and illustrate them side by side in my video. They’re obviously very similar in feel and appearance, and the quality is excellent. I also like the matching Amazon cases that protect the screen when not in use and prop the tablet in either landscape or portrait orientation to make it easy to set it on a table to read or watch videos. The cases work exactly the same for both sizes.The display is the most obvious difference – not only size, but the slightly greater display content and resolution. At least that is what the Amazon specs suggest, but to my eyes they are both pretty much the same. I did find that the 7 model seemed to have a slightly brighter display, and the 'whiteness' of the display also seemed to be better.The other difference I wanted to evaluate was the sound quality, since the 7 model has only a single speaker and the 8 model has two (stereo) speakers with Dolby sound processing. For anyone using this tablet for watching videos or listening to music, I thought that would be an important difference.What I found, as also mentioned elsewhere in this review and with respect to the sound quality, was that the limited volume ability of the built-in speakers makes ear pods or headphones or the use of an external speaker almost mandatory. If those considerations are acceptable, then the higher price of the 8 model is probably well worthwhile for users who will use the table very much to listen to music or videos.For reading Kindle books or those who prefer the smaller and lighter size, the 7” model is just great (either model is fine, really).By comparison, the latest small iPad mini has a 7.0” display and is roughly between the 7” and 8” Fire tablets in size (width and height), quite a bit thinner, and about the same weight as the 7” Fire. It’s considerably more powerful and has 128 GB storage standard, but think about it – you can purchase eight 7” Fire tablets for the price of a single iPad mini today! That is really a striking difference.FURTHER THOUGHTSThese two models are the 7th generation Amazon Fire tablet – the first generation was introduced in November, 2011 as the Kindle Fire, offering the same screen size and resolution but a considerably less powerful processor, and selling for $199. Along the way they’ve offered models of various sizes and specifications, and for a short time (generations 3 and 4) their Fire models included the more sophisticated (and expensive) Fire HDX model that may have been intended to be a more direct competitor to Apple’s iPad.Then, in September 2015, Amazon introduced the $49.99 Fire 7, and since that time it seems that they’ve been happy to offer these bargain priced tablets that do everything that most people really need on a day-to-day basis. They make great Kids tablets, too, particularly the ‘Kids Edition’ models that come with the more protective case and 2-year replacement guarantee, just in case your kid drops it in the, ah, swimming pool or some such!WARRANTYThe standard warranty for both Fire models is a short 90-days. Longer warranties - 1, 2 or 3 years - are available at extra cost ($10.99, $14.99, $16.99 respectively). Compared to most devices this is a very short standard warranty.CAMERA QUALITYBoth Fire models have a 2 MP rear-facing 'HD' camera, and a 'VGA' front-facing 0.3 MP camera. These are very mediocre cameras compared to just about any smart phone or tablet currently available and anyone wanting to take photos or videos with their tablet is not going to be satisfied with the quality that can be obtained from these Fire models, but they do suffice if all you want is to take a photo to make a visual note of something for future reference.INCLUDED ACCESSORIESBoth fire models include a 5W wall charger and a VERY SHORT USB cable (just over 3 ft long).As with pretty much all Amazon Fire and Kindle models these days, you can purchase either of these tablets either with or without ‘special offers’. The $15 difference in price eliminates the ads that show when the screen is locked (but disappear when unlocked).For anyone who wants a smaller and lighter weight tablet, these Fire models have become the logical choice. The prices are now so low that they can be a casual purchase for many people, not quite disposable but something easy to pass on when the next new model comes out.I will continue to add more details here as I use these tablets more and have thoughts and comments to share." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have always one for other options thinking that the Kindle Fire was not what I wanted. I was very,  very wrong.  This next generation of  tablets are amazing!It has about 12 hours battery life, it has  many settings that you can use to save your battery by going off Wifi if you don't need it. It is an 8 inch HD display,  it has a quad core processor, 1.3 gigahertz. It it has 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal storage, and a MicroSD slot for up to 256GB.  So you really have a lot of storage! It is so well made, I was surprised,  because  I have three other tablets which take forever to open. The Amazon Fire comes on instantly. You push the on button and it's on. It also contains 'Alexa',  which will be really helpful in accessing information and entertainment.  You can ask questions, play music,  check your calendar,  you can get news,  and weather,  and so much more.  Just press the home button and ask 'Alexa'.  You can enjoy hundreds of movies,  TV shows,  songs,  Kindle ebooks you can even have a text- to-speech narrator,  who will read the book to you! How AWESOME is that?  I can't say enough about this tablet.  I love it.  It has Netflix,  Facebook,  HBO and Spotify. Prime members get unlimited access to so many things at no additional cost. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!  It seems to have brought us into a different venue.  if not just a tablet anymore,  it now has Alexa and she'll show you how to navigate through this tablet. From one app to another just by speaking. It comes in a variety of colored covers. But this is not a tablet case.  If you want a tablet that is completely covered,  front and back,  you will have to buy a case separately. The case that comes with your Kindle Fire is just the back side of the case it does not cover the front. [...] Thank you for reading my review." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Sometimes I'll extend USB ports from my computers to desk, I have some extending my phone and tablet charging cables, and I have one extending the USB port on the back of my television. It has worked great and as expected for all these uses.The cables feel durable and haven't failed me yet. I also haven't had issues plugging them into anything or plugging things into them whereas another USB extender I had actually got my charging cable stuck inside and broke it when I tried to remove it. They work great and for the price they are easy to recommend." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I bought two of these, and spent about the same amount of money as if I were to buy a decent 24 monitor. They're a little small, but not bad from a foot or so away. The number of inputs is awesome, but I would prefer 2 HDMI over 1 HDMI, VGA, and DVI; today's devices primarily use HDMI. The speakers are, eh, not impressive. At least they're there, unlike a lot of monitors, but the volume is limited and the quality is poor- don't buy this for the speaker.My biggest complaint is that neck that goes into the base is NOT (easily) removable. So, if you plan to mount this on a wall or stand, like me, then you'll have an unsightly black neck sticking out the bottom. I've read you can remove the monitor frame and unscrew the neck, but I tried this and wasn't able to separate the frame without feeling like I was going to break something." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire HD 8 Kids Edition Tablet, 8" HD Display, 32 GB, Pink Kid-Proof Case" review="So I have 2 boys a 6 years old and a 3 year old, they used to share one iPad before and I was planning on buying another one so they could have their own. We are Apple users, everything in my house and office are Apple but seriously when I went to the Apple store Ro buy an iPad  I just felt it was sooo much money for a gadget that my kids throw everywhere, sit on top, etc...so I decided to do some research and found the Amazon Fire 8 kids version to be an interesting option. For the price of one iPad mini I could get 2 Fire HD8 and still save money, so I was like “I’ll try”. Seriously, as soon as I started setting it up I love how everything was so easy and how they separate the content that will be displayed to each kid based on age. A lot of free games, tv shows and movies and the best are the Disney ones, my kids love Disney. The content is free for the first year and then you pay $2.99 per month (the price of one single app on the Apple store)On WiFi, you get the whole set of free shows and stuff and for on the go stuff, I downloaded a bunch of tv shows and games for free with my prime membership.My kids would ask for new games all the time for their iPad and now they couldn’t believe their eyes when they saw all that selection available for them.I definitely recommend this product!!!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have ordered these in the past and they have failed to function. No assembly required and it plugs right in and turns on. The charging ports on the side are also super handy and make the setup very nice. The fans are good and do provide some level of cooling. I tried my system minus the fans and it felt noticeably warmer on the shell and at the vents after 2 hours of Horizon Zero Dawn (clocked from 94.3-97.1 at vents). With the vents it was observed to be operating 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit lower. The plastic thumb stick covers are forgettable." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

This product was the perfect fix, and with it being half the price of the Microsoft version a great deal. I will say that there is a slight buzzing noise but nothing major.

Whoever worked my desk before me left a 4 Hawaiian breeze fan, and it was so terrible. It made a bunch of noise and was ugly.This fan that I just purchased it great! It plugs right into the USB port on my desk top at work, and it is so quiet (compared to my previous one) so it doesn't bug anyone in the cubicle next to me! In the picture, one blade looks pink, but they're all the same color I swear, haha. It was just the glare of the lighting. This pic shows it next to an average sized water bottle.Love this product, would definitely recommend and buy again." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet, 7" Display, 16 GB, Blue Kid-Proof Case" review="I am really sad to give this review anything less than 5 stars, but I would appreciate the understanding as to why. We have owned, now, 4 different Kids Edition Tablets. They have their pros and cons for sure, but we have started to notice a trend with each one. Before I get into why I am no longer a fan of these, I want to express my love for the content and set up.Pros: They have amazing options for kids, of all ages -- and an option to even set up a Kindle based on the age range. There is a huge variety of movies, shows, books, games, characters, etc. and that is great! There is no shortage of entertainment that these can't provide to children, as young at 24 months. We have found that our girls openly express the things they are learning, and we've watched their progress - which, as a parent, you wouldn't ask for much more! The battery life is also great so that helps keep kids entertained for hours, especially on a long car drive. Having the ability to expand the storage is great, and somewhat of a necessity as kids have a tendency to just click everything they see, downloading many gigs of data almost immediately. The case is also an added bonus. It does a great job of protecting the screen and for smaller kids, that's extremely important in extending the usage and life of your device. Kids can easily navigate the menus, parents can monitor the usage and set limits, and of course, the kids portion of the tablet is an add on so adults can use this tablet with ease whenever they choose to: with the ability to access the internet, social media, email, books, video apps, and everything else.Cons: There is only one major downside to these devices, but unfortunately we have seen the same thing happen with all 4 of the kids kindles we have had. The charger ports fail so quickly. The chargers are never secure, they wiggle after days of use and after about a month, the only way to successfully charge your device is through a stabilizer and tape. This method only seems to work out for so long before charging becomes an impossibility and you are back to returning your kindle. Thankfully they now have a 2 year return ability, but previously it was only 1 and we ended up with two non-charging kindles by the end of it. It has been the most disappointing part of having these and you can imagine our kids upset when they find out they no longer can play with their favorite tablet until we can get them, yet again, another one. Over time, the battery life also begins to suffer so I wish the batteries that were used for these items could hold a charge for a longer period of time. There comes a point, right around a year of having the device where a full battery may only last through a movie - we have given our daughter's their devices fully charged at 9am and they are dead, or close to dying, by no later than 11 or noon.These are my only two complaints, unfortunately they are pretty serious complaints and they affect the ability to use the items for as long as I believe you should be able to. If these issues were to be fixed, these would be the perfect kids electronic. Until then, I am definitely wary of purchasing any more of these devices." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Since the price difference between a 128gb SD and a 256gb SD is about $100, I went with the 128. I use this away from home since it is a lot smaller and lighter than my laptops. This is a lot better than using your cell phone1. The customer service both phone and chat is outstanding.2. The Alexa set up is better than it is on the Generation 5.3. I would suggest that you go to “Settings” and the “Help”. An excellent manual is available in “Help”.4. If you are new to the Fire HD 10, Take your time picking out your aps and delete the one that didn’t work out the way you want.5. The screen size is fine and very clear.6. If you have Alexa play music while you work on something on the Fire, you will find that the battery charge will drop faster. For you senior citizens, I am 83 years old and have no trouble using this unit." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Once again, let me state that I know Microsoft puts out software with issues, etc, etc, etc, blah, blah, I chose to have a little faith in them.  Well, it is my opinion that the majority of the negative reviews are user error. After I read some of the success reviews, I pretty much confirmed my suspicions in that most were doing it wrong. You must use an active mini display port adaptor if you have older monitors. Following the suggestions of others I used the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EDSZYII?psc=1&redirect;=true&ref;_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00 adapters and works like a charm. I now have 3 monitors (the surface screen and two external monitors. I just simply connected them, went to my display settings and arranged them in the order I wanted them and that was that. The scaling is perfect, it simply just works. Again, I suspect that those with issues are using passive mini display adapters. Passive don't have the electronics built into the cord and the signal gets lost and compromised creating a failure.2/5/2016: update- still performing flawlessly." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It has solid USB connections. Nothing loose and cheesy about it. I attached it to the face of my tower PC with mounting tape. Looks and functions very solid. I'm an amateur photographer and am constantly disconnecting one-to use it for something else. Having this has saved me a great deal of frustration. I can even leave the cables plugged into the hub and just power off the L.E.D. power switches, so now I don't need to hunt for cables. I'm using it full time now for a month and have had no problems whatsoever. I'm VERY glad I got over some of the if'y reviews and bought this." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I had ordered two of a different brand about a week ago and they were a pain to set up- one never would set up right- and the feed would go in and out and worked about 10% of the time- at best.So far..... I set both of these up in straight up 7 mins total, in two different rooms, of course, the feed, picture quality, panning and scanning is FLAWLESS!!! Tried taking pics and video and works great too! Oh- love the time/date stamp on there too!Our sweet rescue dog has seizures- so I have wanted a means to monitor her for a while- and the set of these cameras is going to be absolutely perfect to fit that need! Oh- and I can spy on the kids when they're home alone, too! Lol.ONLY thing I wish was different-- the cord is a little on the short side- but I'll take that one con for the ease of setup and flawless picture and functionality!!!Straight up would recommend these cameras in a heartbeat!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It was a KDS2600w (26 LCD). It was awesome and it still works perfectly.This monitor is a HUGE improvement over the KDS. It is not much larger but gosh darn, monitor quality has improved greatly during the past 10 years.Everything is beautiful. Photos, videos, and, games all look amazing. Granted, I updated my graphics card also but dang. It's like I went from 2008 to 2018. Which did actually happen.The gloss screen is the only reason I gave this a 4 star. I generally use my computer at night so it is not a big issue. It is an issue during daytime use. You could use this monitor as a mirror. There is a market of products to make a gloss screen matte. Products are available but they are expensive.OH! Also, this larger monitor uses less than half the power of my old monitor!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Google WiFi system, 1-Pack - Router replacement for whole home coverage" review="Bought a new home and setup internet service. Didn't have a router so was looking to purchase one. Google WiFi works great. I have 100 Mbps service from my ISP. On WiFi using the 5 Ghz band, which Google WiFi chooses automatically (it chooses between 2.4 Ghz or 5 Ghz band, whichever signal is better, providing you have BOTH bands available), I get full speed (speedtest.net shows 110 Mbps down, 6 mbps up) as if I was on a wired connection. I was surprised, because I thought I would get around 60-70 Mbps, not the full speed offered. I thought I would have to get a crazy expensive gaming router with 20 antennas that looks like Sauron's helmet from Lord of the Rings to get those speeds, but Google WiFi does that for $170 less and it has cool sci-fi-ish looks.Tips and advice:1. To get full WiFi speed, make sure your device (PC, laptop, tablet, phone, etc.) has both 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz bands. If you don't you'll be stuck at around 30 Mbps to 70 Mbps.2. A SINGLE Google WiFi covers 1500 ft. Make sure you're within that range, or get more to create a mesh network so you fall within WiFi range. My home was 1300 ft. so I only needed one.3. The Google WiFi router only has two ethernet ports, one of which is used to connect to the modem. If you need more wired ports, buy an ethernet switch and connect the router to the switch.4. When WiFi first connects, it will likely connect you to the 2.4 Ghz band. Don't freak out. If you have a 5 Ghz band and the signal is good, it will connect you within 24 hours. It connected me to 2.4 Ghz band the first time I connected for a long while, but the next day when I started my PC again, it was now using the 5 Ghz band." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I didn't want to pay $80 for an Apple adapter, so I was delighted to find these fine people selling genuine Apple adapters for $60.  I sorta wondered how they could manage to do that (Apple tightly controls the market price of their products), but I wanted to believe.The adapter arrived working and it looked very much like a real OEM Apple adapter.  All the fine print, certifications, etc. looked like my original adapter.But after 10 months of use, it died.  On a hunch, I opened it up.  It was a cheap knockoff.  It was easy to tell.  What I saw was basically the same as what this tear down found: [...]Note how official the fake on that web page looks.  Well that's what you're getting here.  I've attached a photo of what I found.  Note the low component density and terrible soldering.  It's crap.So I paid $60 for a charger that lasted 10 months (apparently I was one of the lucky ones to have it last that long).  Now I've got to suck it up and pay $80 for a real one.$60 to learn what I already knew:  TANSTAAFL, and you get what you pay for.  Don't waste your money here.Edit: For some reason this charger is $80 now - don't know if that means they are now selling actual Apple chargers or if they're just getting $20 more for their cheap knock-off.  Either way I'd avoid this vendor." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have always one for other options thinking that the Kindle Fire was not what I wanted. I was very,  very wrong.  This next generation of  tablets are amazing!It has about 12 hours battery life, it has  many settings that you can use to save your battery by going off Wifi if you don't need it. It is an 8 inch HD display,  it has a quad core processor, 1.3 gigahertz. It it has 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal storage, and a MicroSD slot for up to 256GB.  So you really have a lot of storage! It is so well made, I was surprised,  because  I have three other tablets which take forever to open. The Amazon Fire comes on instantly. You push the on button and it's on. It also contains 'Alexa',  which will be really helpful in accessing information and entertainment.  You can ask questions, play music,  check your calendar,  you can get news,  and weather,  and so much more.  Just press the home button and ask 'Alexa'.  You can enjoy hundreds of movies,  TV shows,  songs,  Kindle ebooks you can even have a text- to-speech narrator,  who will read the book to you! How AWESOME is that?  I can't say enough about this tablet.  I love it.  It has Netflix,  Facebook,  HBO and Spotify. Prime members get unlimited access to so many things at no additional cost. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!  It seems to have brought us into a different venue.  if not just a tablet anymore,  it now has Alexa and she'll show you how to navigate through this tablet. From one app to another just by speaking. It comes in a variety of colored covers. But this is not a tablet case.  If you want a tablet that is completely covered,  front and back,  you will have to buy a case separately. The case that comes with your Kindle Fire is just the back side of the case it does not cover the front. [...] Thank you for reading my review." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

The choice then comes down to whether you get SB6183 or SB6141.  Honestly, for $30 less and speeds up to 343Mbps the SB6141 should seem like an easy choice for 99% of people.  But I decided to opt for the SB61483 for three reasons.- Comcast is listing the SB6141 in such a way that makes me think it will be considered end-of-life soon while the SB6183 is still very much current.- The SB6183 has 16 channels down as opposed to just 8 on the SB6141.  Theoretically this means that at peak times you are less likely to experience your speed slowing down.  Be aware your service area must be configured to support this otherwise those channels don't help.- Comcast used to charge me $10 a month to rent a modem/router, so the extra $30 will pay itself back quickly.I do have one gripe about the box though.  My issue is that the designers made the indicator LEDs brighter than the lights used to illuminate football fields at night.  I initially placed mine on the shelf under my TV and trying to watch TV was like having headlights pointed into my eyes.  I recommend welder's goggles to avoid long term retina damage.  No joke, these things are so bright that the light from them seeps under the door into my bedroom and is bright in there.  Even considering the efficiency of LEDs I'm concerned my next electric bill will reflect the fact that I've used more power than a mid-sized office building to create this much illumination.  But I'm a resourceful dude so I figured I would just fold a piece of paper over a few times and tape it over the front of the box to shield my eyes from this Eye of Sauron.Well, that should have worked.  Unfortunately, every surface of the box other than the base is covered with air vent holes.  I was afraid I would cause the device of overheat if I blocked those vents, so at this point I got kind of desperate so I took out the 1 and only screw and cut a slip in the sticker on the bottom so that I could open to box up.  As you can see from the attached pictures, the LEDs are deigned so that they actually face out of the box and only a small amount of light makes it to the indicators on the front.  I did the very best I could to cover this with electrical tape, but because of the way it is mounted in there it is hard cover the under side.  This made the problem about 50% better but it is still bright enough to act as a night light for the entire living room and kitchen.I may be certifiable for knocking off two stars for a cosmetic problem on a modem, but these are my feelings...***UPDATE***I've changed my review from 3 stars to 4.  This is due to the helpful comment from J. Cohen which gave me hope that I could switch off the lights.  However, my hopes were dashed when I realized the solution turned off all lights EXCEPT the power LED.  It's a bit like learning you can get rid of MOST of the rats in your bed.  I guess it makes it better, but I'm still uncomfortable.If you want to do this yourself here are the step:1) Open a browser window.2) Type the following number into your address bar: 192.168.100.13) Go to the Configuration tab.4) Set Turn off front panel LEDs except power LED to Enable5) Rejoice that you've turned off 75% off the blinding spotlights" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Compatible with Gig-Speed from Xfinity (CM1000)" review="I upgraded my speed with my ISP to 1 Gbps but my old Arris modem wouldn't cut it. After doing some research and I narrowed down to Motorola and this Netgear CM1000. I've had several Netgear products before and they are all pretty reliable so I decided to give it a try. I managed to get close to 1 Gbps with this modem. When I did a raw wired test, I could hit the speed to around 980 Mbps consistently.This is what I did to make things work seemlessly.1. Do not unplug your old modem yet2. Take a picture of the MAC and Serial number of the CM1000 (should be on the box too)3. Sit the new CM 1000 next to your old modem then call your ISP (I use Comcast)4. Tell them that you need to replace your modem and have your model, MAC, and serial number (they don't ask sometimes) ready5. Once they input the MAC in their system, swap the modem, give it about 3 minutes to boot up then you're rock and rolling6. Keep your old modem for contingencyHope this review helps and if it does, please give me a thumb up." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet, 7" Display, 16 GB, Pink Kid-Proof Case" review="I am really sad to give this review anything less than 5 stars, but I would appreciate the understanding as to why. We have owned, now, 4 different Kids Edition Tablets. They have their pros and cons for sure, but we have started to notice a trend with each one. Before I get into why I am no longer a fan of these, I want to express my love for the content and set up.Pros: They have amazing options for kids, of all ages -- and an option to even set up a Kindle based on the age range. There is a huge variety of movies, shows, books, games, characters, etc. and that is great! There is no shortage of entertainment that these can't provide to children, as young at 24 months. We have found that our girls openly express the things they are learning, and we've watched their progress - which, as a parent, you wouldn't ask for much more! The battery life is also great so that helps keep kids entertained for hours, especially on a long car drive. Having the ability to expand the storage is great, and somewhat of a necessity as kids have a tendency to just click everything they see, downloading many gigs of data almost immediately. The case is also an added bonus. It does a great job of protecting the screen and for smaller kids, that's extremely important in extending the usage and life of your device. Kids can easily navigate the menus, parents can monitor the usage and set limits, and of course, the kids portion of the tablet is an add on so adults can use this tablet with ease whenever they choose to: with the ability to access the internet, social media, email, books, video apps, and everything else.Cons: There is only one major downside to these devices, but unfortunately we have seen the same thing happen with all 4 of the kids kindles we have had. The charger ports fail so quickly. The chargers are never secure, they wiggle after days of use and after about a month, the only way to successfully charge your device is through a stabilizer and tape. This method only seems to work out for so long before charging becomes an impossibility and you are back to returning your kindle. Thankfully they now have a 2 year return ability, but previously it was only 1 and we ended up with two non-charging kindles by the end of it. It has been the most disappointing part of having these and you can imagine our kids upset when they find out they no longer can play with their favorite tablet until we can get them, yet again, another one. Over time, the battery life also begins to suffer so I wish the batteries that were used for these items could hold a charge for a longer period of time. There comes a point, right around a year of having the device where a full battery may only last through a movie - we have given our daughter's their devices fully charged at 9am and they are dead, or close to dying, by no later than 11 or noon.These are my only two complaints, unfortunately they are pretty serious complaints and they affect the ability to use the items for as long as I believe you should be able to. If these issues were to be fixed, these would be the perfect kids electronic. Until then, I am definitely wary of purchasing any more of these devices." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8" 32 GB Wifi Tablet (Silver)" review="This Samsung Tablet just what I was looking for and I have owned this for one and a half months now. I usually purchase my Tablets and Smartphones from Amazon, however, it was not yet on Amazon's website at that time. Since I am a techie type, I throughly tested this tablet before I wrote this review.Below, I list the Pros and Cons that I personally discovered:+ Screen Resolution/Form Factor:The screen resolution is excellent at 189ppi. I find that the screen is clearer than my old Tab A 8.0 was. Also, colors are vivid.+ OS and Preinstalled Apps...The OS is Nougat 7.1.1+ Regarding Form Factor...I prefer the 16:10 form factor in this Samsung Tab A 2017 over my older Samsung Tab A 2015 with the 4:3 form factor. This Tablet is easier for me to hold and the videos fill the screen better.+ Internal Memory/ External Memory Card info--this tablet is advertised at 32GB Internal Memory. However, after the OS and Factory Apps were installed, it began with about 25GB of available internal memory. So when I added my many apps, updates, etc, I now have 19.25GB left. This is enough space to future apps, updates etc.+Memory Card storage...I discovered that I can install an SD Card up to 256GB. However, I installed (for now) a 64GB and still have 20gb left on it.+ Speed/Responsiveness/Battery Temp/Battery Life...This tablet is very peppy, does not lag or freeze.Battery is non removable and it has a good amount of power at 5,000 mAh. The battery does not overheat even with downloading apps, watching videos etc. Under normal use it is 80 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit and after downloading apps, watching videos etc, it goes up to 90 to 95 degrees, which is normal, and it quickly goes back down to 80 to 85. I use the free widget called Battery Solo from the Playstore. It shows my battery amount left on my screen and when I tap it, it gives a report of how long the battery has been used and the time left on the battery.Battery Life: The battery has lasted easily from 8am to about 730pm if I use it moderately to heavy as I am on weather apps, Facebook, email, Internet, YouTube on and off most of the day. *I get about 2 hours longer on this 2017 Tab A than I did on my old Tab A 2015.+ WiFi...802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-band. I use ATT UVERSE and this tablet has superb and fast WiFi. Even outside in my backyard, it still gets 3 bars. I am very pleased with this tablet's WiFi. Also, on the road, it picks up local WiFi wonderfully.+ Camera...This camera has a flash, I am happy to report. And it has 8MP, not the best, however, the pictures and videos I took with it are quite clear...I was happily suprized about that!Sound Quality...It is SO SO as there is just one speaker. I tested this watching videos on YouTube, Facebook and music on my SD Card. It was doable in a pinch, however, I use a set of high quality Bluetooth headset and a high quality Bluetooth speaker. With a Bluetooth speaker or headset, the sound is wonderful.+ Overall Reasons why I love this tablet: Personally, I found this to be a very impressive and love the screen to body ratio which is 70.5, excellent. It is slim and trim, and easily fits into my purse.My favorite features are the 32GB Internal Memory, my old Tab A 8.0 had just 16GB, too small for today's apps etc and the lo get battery life.Cons: Just one that I discovered:- Sound...just one tiny speaker. I use Bluetooth Headset and a Bluetooth speaker so I did not deduct stars.Would I purchase this tablet again? Yes, because it has many advantages over my older Tab A 2015 Model.Well, I hope that this review has helped with your decision regarding this tablet. Thank you for reading my review.Since I am a techie, I will gladly answer your questions in the comment section." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa, 7" Display, 8 GB, Canary Yellow - with Special Offers" review=" Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. It’s still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and it’s such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7” model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7” 8 or 16 GB; 8” 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8” model is $10 cheaper--- the 7” model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7” model). Note that the Kids edition is only sold with the higher storage (7” – 16 GB; 8” – 32 GB)--- both models can use up to 256 GB microSDXC expansion storage (previously max 128 GB for 7”)--- both models offer Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant at the touch of a button--- both models are physically the same size as previously but slightly lighter – the 8” has lost 1 oz of weight, the 7” is 0.6 oz lighter- BOTH 7” and 8” MODELS are suitable for:--- web surfing using Amazon’s Silk browser--- watching streaming movies or TV shows **--- listening to music **--- reading Kindle books (the 7” is roughly the same size as a Kindle)--- playing games and other apps (within the limitation of Amazon's own ecosystem)--- Kid use – both offer the ability to set up child accounts with restricted access--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- IN ADDITION, THE 8” FIRE HAS:--- slightly larger and higher quality display (but I found both displays to be essentially equivalent in quality)--- larger standard storage (16 GB vs 8 GB)--- better sound – Dolby audio, stereo (7” has mono speaker) **--- larger battery / longer life between charges (Amazon states up to 12 hours, vs up to 8 hrs for the 7”)--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- WHAT DON’T THEY DO AND WHAT ARE THEIR LIMITATIONS?--- Neither model will display 1080p video--- camera specs are poor compared to most current phone and higher priced tablets, so don’t expect high resolution photos--- Sound quality and volume ability is a limitation - see next paragraph--- With limited built in storage, they both rely upon the expansion slot to store larger amounts of photos, videos, or music. Responsiveness using memory from the expansion slot is not quite the same as with a tablet that has greater hard wired storage built-in--- All Fire models are limited to using Amazon’s own Silk web browser, which is less flexible than the regular Chrome or Firefox browsers that can be used on regular Android or Apple tablets- THE SOUND QUALITY AND MAXIMUM VOLUME CAPABILITY IS A WEAK POINT--- Accepting the fact that these are very low cost tablets, they do offer the ability to listen to videos and music and so the built-in speakers will be relied upon by many users. In my opinion the most significant difference between these two Fire models, aside from the screen size, is the difference in sound quality. But I first want to say that neither model has the ability to provide much volume of sound, even at the very highest setting. This is a disappointment.--- The 7 Fire has a single speaker located on the rear of the device, near the bottom. It is weak and produces a very low quality sound. Also, depending on how you are holding the tablet, or if you're using a case to hold it in landscape or portrait mode, the speaker could be covered and even further muffled.--- The 8 HD Fire has better quality sound - two stereo speakers located on the side, positioned so that they will be at the top when the tablet is supported in landscape mode. It also has better sound processing ('Dolby Atmos'), and the sound quality is noticeably better than the 7. Still, the maximum volume capability is modest.--- Bottom line - if you plan to use either model for listening to music or videos, then ear pods or headphones or an external speaker is probably going to be necessary in order to get satisfactory sound. Sound quality is not going to be something owners of these small Fire tablets will be bragging about.- MY IMPRESSIONS OF BOTH MODELS AND HOW THEY COMPAREI purchased both models and illustrate them side by side in my video. They’re obviously very similar in feel and appearance, and the quality is excellent. I also like the matching Amazon cases that protect the screen when not in use and prop the tablet in either landscape or portrait orientation to make it easy to set it on a table to read or watch videos. The cases work exactly the same for both sizes.The display is the most obvious difference – not only size, but the slightly greater display content and resolution. At least that is what the Amazon specs suggest, but to my eyes they are both pretty much the same. I did find that the 7 model seemed to have a slightly brighter display, and the 'whiteness' of the display also seemed to be better.The other difference I wanted to evaluate was the sound quality, since the 7 model has only a single speaker and the 8 model has two (stereo) speakers with Dolby sound processing. For anyone using this tablet for watching videos or listening to music, I thought that would be an important difference.What I found, as also mentioned elsewhere in this review and with respect to the sound quality, was that the limited volume ability of the built-in speakers makes ear pods or headphones or the use of an external speaker almost mandatory. If those considerations are acceptable, then the higher price of the 8 model is probably well worthwhile for users who will use the table very much to listen to music or videos.For reading Kindle books or those who prefer the smaller and lighter size, the 7” model is just great (either model is fine, really).By comparison, the latest small iPad mini has a 7.0” display and is roughly between the 7” and 8” Fire tablets in size (width and height), quite a bit thinner, and about the same weight as the 7” Fire. It’s considerably more powerful and has 128 GB storage standard, but think about it – you can purchase eight 7” Fire tablets for the price of a single iPad mini today! That is really a striking difference.FURTHER THOUGHTSThese two models are the 7th generation Amazon Fire tablet – the first generation was introduced in November, 2011 as the Kindle Fire, offering the same screen size and resolution but a considerably less powerful processor, and selling for $199. Along the way they’ve offered models of various sizes and specifications, and for a short time (generations 3 and 4) their Fire models included the more sophisticated (and expensive) Fire HDX model that may have been intended to be a more direct competitor to Apple’s iPad.Then, in September 2015, Amazon introduced the $49.99 Fire 7, and since that time it seems that they’ve been happy to offer these bargain priced tablets that do everything that most people really need on a day-to-day basis. They make great Kids tablets, too, particularly the ‘Kids Edition’ models that come with the more protective case and 2-year replacement guarantee, just in case your kid drops it in the, ah, swimming pool or some such!WARRANTYThe standard warranty for both Fire models is a short 90-days. Longer warranties - 1, 2 or 3 years - are available at extra cost ($10.99, $14.99, $16.99 respectively). Compared to most devices this is a very short standard warranty.CAMERA QUALITYBoth Fire models have a 2 MP rear-facing 'HD' camera, and a 'VGA' front-facing 0.3 MP camera. These are very mediocre cameras compared to just about any smart phone or tablet currently available and anyone wanting to take photos or videos with their tablet is not going to be satisfied with the quality that can be obtained from these Fire models, but they do suffice if all you want is to take a photo to make a visual note of something for future reference.INCLUDED ACCESSORIESBoth fire models include a 5W wall charger and a VERY SHORT USB cable (just over 3 ft long).As with pretty much all Amazon Fire and Kindle models these days, you can purchase either of these tablets either with or without ‘special offers’. The $15 difference in price eliminates the ads that show when the screen is locked (but disappear when unlocked).For anyone who wants a smaller and lighter weight tablet, these Fire models have become the logical choice. The prices are now so low that they can be a casual purchase for many people, not quite disposable but something easy to pass on when the next new model comes out.I will continue to add more details here as I use these tablets more and have thoughts and comments to share." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

You cannot find such display in laptops up to $750+The colour is a beautiful grey and not purple as reviewed by other users+Excellent specs with proper  upgradeability, ( free m2 slot , memory can be increased compared to models with soldered modules)+fingerprint sensor is accurateCons-No computer is 2017 should be shipped with an HDD. This HDD makes the machine really slow,Until the first round of boots/restarts and updates is competed you will think that you have bought a entry level celeron. The disk works full load and cannot cope, (it is fine for very basic tasks but you did not buy an 8250u for basic tasks).-Keyboard is not that good, i fell that there is uneven uniformity in the button press and travel, and definitely some flex,-power button next to delete button ? So you end up switch off while typing, (same button arrangement in many small form factor laptops.-Caps lock without a led notification, not so clever,Now the ssd part,I got a Crucial mx300 m.2 ssd it comes with m2 crews and free acronis clone softwareInstallation needs patience and some proper tools.1.carefully remove all screws including the 2x under the rear rubber pads2. get a PLASTIC prying tool or a thin guitar pick and carefully lift the cover starting from an edge near one of the corners, do not use screwdriver or knife, you will damage the plastic,3. with the help of your plastic tool unclip one be one all the platic clips,4.remove cover and install the m2 ssd (face down for crucial) no extra force to snap in5. get back the cover and do all the screws (3 different types of screws)6 power  the device pressing constantly F2 to enter bios, see that your ssd has been identified,7 download the cloning software, acronis, macrium or other. Clone the disks (automated step by step process)8 enter bios (F2 and power) and select m2 as first boot device9 no trouble with windows licence, you can wipe the HDD via disk managmenet10 completely delete all the partitions of old HDD use Diskpart applications for the command line,now you have a proper  FAST machine with an extra 1TB storage drive, it is 5x faster in nominal terms but it feels 50x times faster in reality." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Nothing wrong with this hardware I give it 5 stars and I called customer support about an issue and rate it 10 out of 10. With that said let talk about issues I had.  I have comcast.. I know I know... Its the fastest I can get in my area. I first call comcast to get the MAC address added and after that I did a speed test and I normally got 120Mbps download and 10 Mpbs upload. After installing the modem I was getting 60Mbps download and 5Mbps upload. I called comcast and after BLAH BLAH everything (I am a network admin) I already did they said I have a 3rd party and its not a comcast modem, the modem in which its on there approval list. I called Arris and man the tech was so nice! They confirmed my it was my ISP issues. I called comcast again and asked to modem activation and let them know I need my modem re-provisioned. After that I went from and fake Onsite service call to proper internet speed. I was a 60Mbps down, 5Mbps up to............ 180Mbps down, 11Mbps up.When you buy this modem test your speed before and see what your paying for. If you have speed issues then its your ISP cheating you or bad activation programming.When you call your ISP you need to use key words as I have learned. They Are...Modem ActivationAndRe-provisioned" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Surround Sound is very nice (requires use of included USB sound card) and really ups the immersion on games that support the surround sound.  Microphone Quality is on par however for most programs you will need to have the microphone volume set in the operating system at 98 - 100 percent (much lower than that and voice detection starts falling off for most chat programs).  Cord is long (VERY long) and has a Velcro strap for management. Inline volume adjustment and mute switch are a major plus!CONS:Aside from having to mute the microphone feedback in the Playback Devices settings the only real negative thing I have to say about these is the quality of construction. The piece just about where the cups attach to the headband is notorious for cracking. Once it cracks it's only a matter of time before the whole plastic plate is falling off and you are either contacting warranty or buying a new pair. I have had to replace mine once already through warranty and my new pair is already cracking. I owned the first pair for 6 months before they broke fully and the new pair not even 2 months and it's already cracked. I'm not a violent gamer so I don't throw my headset around. I even hang it carefully on the side of my desk where it's safely stored when not in use. I'm believe it is simply due to how wide my head is. The headband itself doesn't adjust to accommodate wider heads while the ear cups are adjustable to accommodate people with taller heads which I feel is where the flaw is in the design. In the attached images you can see where it broke and where it cracks. This stress point is most certainly caused by the poor construction at the joint." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Since the price difference between a 128gb SD and a 256gb SD is about $100, I went with the 128. I use this away from home since it is a lot smaller and lighter than my laptops. This is a lot better than using your cell phone1. The customer service both phone and chat is outstanding.2. The Alexa set up is better than it is on the Generation 5.3. I would suggest that you go to “Settings” and the “Help”. An excellent manual is available in “Help”.4. If you are new to the Fire HD 10, Take your time picking out your aps and delete the one that didn’t work out the way you want.5. The screen size is fine and very clear.6. If you have Alexa play music while you work on something on the Fire, you will find that the battery charge will drop faster. For you senior citizens, I am 83 years old and have no trouble using this unit." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Dell USB 3.0 Ultra HD/4K Triple Display Docking Station (D3100)" review="Well, I have been using one of these docks for almost a year now, and I have been extremely impressed. The picture quality is great, and the functionality is very reliable. I do, however, have two complaints.Firstly, the setup is not as simple as it should be. There is firmware available on the Dell website, as well as on the DisplayLink website, but no native software application for managing the displays once installed. You are forced to use the Windows display management software, which is absolutely not user friendly, especially if you are running triple monitors or more. It takes some time to get everything set up and working properly, but once you get it done, you should not have any further issues.Secondly, this dock has a DisplayPort output. If, however, you own or intend to purchase monitors, like my three Dell U2414H flat panels, with MST (Multi-Stream Transport) capability (aka Daisy Chaining) you will be disappointed to learn that this dock does NOT support MST. Rather than connecting multiple monitors to one display output, you have to run a separate video cable for every single monitor. What's worse, the dock only has one DisplayPort output, the other two outputs are HDMI, so if your monitors came with DisplayPort cables like mine did, you will have to buy additional HDMI cables as well...None of these issues is a deal breaker, and now that I am set up, I am EXTREMELY happy with the end result, but just a little bit of info I wish I had known prior to making my purchases." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have always one for other options thinking that the Kindle Fire was not what I wanted. I was very,  very wrong.  This next generation of  tablets are amazing!It has about 12 hours battery life, it has  many settings that you can use to save your battery by going off Wifi if you don't need it. It is an 8 inch HD display,  it has a quad core processor, 1.3 gigahertz. It it has 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal storage, and a MicroSD slot for up to 256GB.  So you really have a lot of storage! It is so well made, I was surprised,  because  I have three other tablets which take forever to open. The Amazon Fire comes on instantly. You push the on button and it's on. It also contains 'Alexa',  which will be really helpful in accessing information and entertainment.  You can ask questions, play music,  check your calendar,  you can get news,  and weather,  and so much more.  Just press the home button and ask 'Alexa'.  You can enjoy hundreds of movies,  TV shows,  songs,  Kindle ebooks you can even have a text- to-speech narrator,  who will read the book to you! How AWESOME is that?  I can't say enough about this tablet.  I love it.  It has Netflix,  Facebook,  HBO and Spotify. Prime members get unlimited access to so many things at no additional cost. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!  It seems to have brought us into a different venue.  if not just a tablet anymore,  it now has Alexa and she'll show you how to navigate through this tablet. From one app to another just by speaking. It comes in a variety of colored covers. But this is not a tablet case.  If you want a tablet that is completely covered,  front and back,  you will have to buy a case separately. The case that comes with your Kindle Fire is just the back side of the case it does not cover the front. [...] Thank you for reading my review." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I'm provisioned for the 105/20 Mbps package and typically get 120/20.5 Mbps.This modem can utilize up to 8 channels of downstream for a theoretical max speed of 343 Mbps whereas the Motorola SB6121 and other earlier/cheaper DOCSIS 3 modems can only utilize 4 channels maxing your download speeds out at 172 Mbps.  Just something to think about if you plan on using this modem for a few years as speeds offered will inevitably increase.Also, it *does* support IPv6 even though Comcast's page doesn't list it as certified yet.  Motorola's data sheet specifically lists the SB6141 as IPv6 ready and tests with an Apple AirPort Extreme (v7.6.4) and MacBook Pro running 10.9 confirm this.Update 2/4/13:  Still working great without issue.Update 3/25/13:  Still not even a single reboot required.Update 8/28/13:  Still working great...Update 7/8/14:  First issue...  had an outage for 15 min.  Reset the modem and it didn't resolve the issue.  Called Comcast, they reset something on their end and I was up and running again.  First issue since I bought it.Update 4/5/2015:  Comcast recently upgraded my speed tier and I'm consistently getting speeds up to 180/25 Mbps." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I admit, I've only had it a short time, but this router is, by far, the biggest bang for the buck router I've ever owned. The router I replaced would give an anemic borderline 1 bar in our bedroom 2 floors up. I had to use an extender to get coverage everywhere in the house. When the main router went belly-up, I saw this one and was a little skeptical of the reviews... it sounded too good to be true. But I kid you not, I now have 3 bars up in the bedroom, and the poor little extender is going to atrophy due to non use! The range on this thing is absolutely, without question, the best I have ever seen. Set-up is a breeze, I was up and running less than 5 minutes after plugging it in to the cable modem. Would buy again, and encourage you to give it serious consideration if you need a good long range router without busting your wallet." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

There are 4 important points I'd like to make:1) All these years I paid for a 50mbps speed from my cable company. I had an older Netgear from 2009 which has served me well all these years (and still works) but I decided it was time to upgrade. Typically I was getting only 12-17mbps through my wi-fi (for example, to my iPhone6). After getting this Nighthawk Router, I now get 57mbps on the same iPhone. All of my devices are much faster now... PS4, iPhones, iPads, Epson Printer, Baby Monitor, Tablets, Roku 3 box, Roku Streaming Stick, etc...2) Cables .... Please note, one other thing I did in addition to getting this router is that I also bought all new cat6 cables (from Amazon Basics), and that has helped the router to connect well to the cable modem. From the router itself, I have a few wired items (Roku 3 box, PS4, my PC). And note that I tested the Roku 3 box, PS4, and PC wirelessly as well. In all conditions, wired with Cat6 cables and/or wi-fi, this Nighthawk router has delivered the speeds I was missing for years.3) Interface.... Also, I like the interface for setting up and using the router. I like that you get two options of 2.4ghz or 5ghz connection. One thing to keep in mind is that some older devices can only use 2.4g so it is that old device itself that limits the connection speed (not your wi-fi necessarily). Newer devices are 5g capable and can maximize the speed capability.4) Security... I also like the Access Control feature so that you have to permit a device to connect to your wi-fi. For example, when I got a new iPad this Christmas, I logged into my wi-fi network and put in the proper password, but it wouldn't connect to the internet. Then I went to the Netgear interface on my PC and it displayed that the iPad had been blocked (because Access Control is turned on). So then I simply hit a check box to allow the iPad onto my home network, and then it connected.Finally, I am not a tech person, I just try to read up on things to the best of my ability. I hope my review helps some of you.5 STARS" data-balloon="See users review on this product."
