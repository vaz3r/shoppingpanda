                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player" review="Earlier this month, my TV entertainment included Dish 200+ channel satellite TV, 20Mbps turbo internet, Netflix, and Amazon Prime. After doing some research, I bought 3 Amazon Fire Sticks with the voice remote, cancelled Dish, upgraded to 30Mbps internet, added Sling 25 channels, added standard Hulu, and CBS All Access. Guess who still gets 96+% of the channels watched, added Prime Music and several hundred shows (that networks don't play) to all the TVs in the house, and saved over $700 per year compared to what I paid this past year? I did. I never thought of cutting the cord until I really looked into it all. Getting Amazon Fire Sticks are worth it and they work well....and once you get used to knowing what show plays where, it's a no-brainer. Just like how you originally had to figure out how to use a smart phone back in the day. After a while, it's a breeze. I highly recommend everything I listed in this review. Seriously....take a couple hours and make a spread-sheet listing the must-have shows that people in your household watch. Then make a comparison to what's available on the streaming services. If you're like me, and you don't watch 80% of the channels you pay for, it's so worth it." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

If the film goes through any type of X-ray it will ruin it. I highly recommend putting it in your checked luggage and then just politely ask the TSA agents to set it aside." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Roku Express | 5X more powerful HD Streaming" review="Fantastic product so far!  After the first week, we bought a second one for a family member.First thing:  Before you buy, understand what content is free and what is not.  Second, in case it's not obvious, the Roku operates over your wifi and internet connection.  You have to have an internet connection that is fast enough to stream video.  If you can't stream video on your mobile (via wifi) or PC, you won't be able to stream it on the Roku either.Subscription content: Anything that you have to pay for elsewhere (like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, network TV streaming, etc), you'll still have to have those same subscriptions.  But the Roku allows you to access all of those subscriptions (the ones you're paying for) from a single device on your TV, with a nice interface that nearly anyone can use, even if they're technology-illiterate.  Worst case, if you get lost somewhere, just press the Home button.  (But keep in mind, each 'channel' on Roku is an app written by the individual content provider, so some are a little more complicated than others.  I suspect for marketing reasons, it's not always obvious on some of the network TV channels which content is free versus paid until you try to play it.  But you'll always be prompted before paying for anything, and you can add a pin-number to prevent accidental purchases).Ad-supported content: There is a lot of ad-supported content, just like watching free over-the-air (OTA) TV stations.  For network TV (ABC, NBC, CBS, CW, etc), check each network's website to see what shows you can watch for free directly on their website, and that's generally what you'll be able to watch on Roku, too.  After all, the 'channels' on Roku are apps written by each network.  For many networks, the free content includes the last 3 to 5 episodes of things that are currently airing, with content being made available a week after the original broadcast date.  This is comes in handy if you miss an episode or two of over-the-air TV.  Some of the networks also offer free 'throwback' content, where you can watch an entire series of an older show.  And there are a few channels like pluto.tv and tubi.tv that provide a wide assortment of ad-supported movies and TV shows.  Again, check their corresponding websites to see what content they currently have, and that's what you'll get on Roku.  The ones mentioned above offer some relatively recent content, in addition to a lot of older and slightly-older content.Free, without ads:  Mostly, you'll find that the ad-free content is extremely old...  lots of black-and-white TV and movies, some early color TV/movies, etc.  For those who don't like much of what's on TV these days, there's a lot of classy and classic stuff here.  And, of course, a lot of b- and c-grade stuff you've never heard of.This newest version of the Roku Express (5X more powerful) has a very smooth interface, with good response from the remote.  Video startup is extremely fast if you have decent internet speed.  I tested on a relative's 6mbps DSL internet, and buffering times were never uncomfortable.  On my faster internet (100mbps), videos either start instantly, or take no more than about 1 or 2 seconds of buffering.The remote control is great -- simple, strong signal, good range.  It's infrared-based, so you have to be in the same room (why would you want to be out of the room??).  I generally don't even have to point the remote at the Roku box, because the infrared is strong enough to reflect off of the ceiling or walls and still work.  Just be sure your Roku box's front side is unobscured and pointing toward the room.  They provide a sticky-tape strip to stick the box somewhere convenient, like the side or top of your TV or media cabinet.  The provided HDMI cable is only 2 feet long, though, so it does have to be relatively close to the TV.  But you could use a different HDMI cable if you need the remote to be a little farther away.  One feature I love about the remote is that pressing the Home button will turn on your TV and switch to the Roku's HDMI input, assuming your TV supports this (I have a Samsung TV which is supported, and a TCL TV which apparently wasn't).You can also use the Roku app on your mobile to control the Roku via wifi.  In addition to providing an interface that looks pretty similar to the physical remote, you can also browse for other content while something is already playing.  It fact, it's quite a bit easier to navigate if you're searching for something specific, since the physical remote requires using an on-screen keyboard where you select each letter and click OK (normally, I'm not searching for something specific on the physical remote, so it's not a problem).  The app also has a headphone feature, which I'm guessing allows you to listen directly from your mobile instead of via the TV... great for watching at night when others are sleeping.  Note, the Roku app is NOT designed to watch Roku content directly on your mobile.  It simply lets you select the content to watch on the TV.Overall, it's a great experience.  My only subscription at the moment is Amazon prime, which doesn't have a lot of content that I really want to watch (sorry, Amazon!  I have Prime mostly for the shipping), so I use the Roku mostly for ad-supported TV and movies, and there's more than enough to keep me busy for a long time." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire TV Cube | Hands-Free with Alexa and 4K Ultra HD | Streaming Media Player" review="I just got the Amazon fire TV cube this last Friday and spent some time with it this weekend. Here are my thoughts:Set-up was a breeze, simply plug in an HDMI cable (not included) and power cable and you are good to go. Set your TV to the correct input and follow the on-screen instructions. As long as the device was purchased with your Amazon account the device will be pre-loaded with your account email and password which hurries installation along. I also connected a Sonos sound bar in a few clicks was extremely nice.My only gripe about the installation was there was not a clear way to pull through apps, games, and log-ins from my previous fire TV. This means you have to re-download all your streaming apps and re-sync them which is a PITA. Not sure if there is an automatic option for this but I could not find it. This is something you would have to do with any new device so I will not fault Amazon here but it’s always a bit time consuming to get all your apps and log-ins synced back up.Pro’sThere are a lot of cool features such as:- Ask Alexa the weather and a 7 day and your TV will turn on and show you the 7 day forecast. Alexa will continue to respond and answer as normal but it adds a quick visual component as well.- Ask Alexa to play a song and your TV will turn on and show the album artwork, song, artist, and scroll through the lyrics karaoke style.- Ask Alexa for movie play times and you guess it, your TV will turn on and visually show you play times.- Basically, most things you are used to asking Alexa will likely turn your TV on to show you a visual component as well.- I had my Fire TV cube about 1 ft. or less away from my Sonos play base speaker and Alexa did not have any trouble hearing the wake word.- You can set your flash news briefing to sites that support video news which is a cool feature.- If you are trying to purchase something Alexa will show you the options, prices, etc. on screen which is nice to double check and know what you are ordering.- Play music through your TV/stereo system instead of a little Alexa Speaker for better audio. Since I hooked up a Sonos play base speaker all audio comes out of the playbase instead of the fireTV cube.- Ever play jeopardy and cannot understand what Alexa is saying? Most games have a visual component now where questions and information will appear on screen which is a big plus as well.Con’s- Not sure if this is an option but Alexa will turn the TV on quite a bit to show you something. It does not appear that she will turn the TV off afterwards as I constantly noticed my TV was on this weekend. I would imagine there is an option or this will change in an update, alternatively I could set my TV on a sleep timer as Alexa is not displaying content to turn off.- After saying the wake word it takes an extra half second or so before there is a visual display to begin talking. I noticed, I can usually start talking before the visual indicator and Alexa will still hear the whole thing but it makes you pause before saying Alexa which does not happen on the normal Alexa devices. Again, likely a software update coming soon I would guess.- If you do not know what you are looking for the process is a bit intense. For example, “show action movies”, there will be numbers next to each movie so you could say, “play movie 4” for example or, “swipe right”, “select movie 4”, etc. AS you can imagine if you do not know what you want to watch and are searching for something this is handled more gracefully with the remote.There is a laundry list of cool things you can do with your fireTv cube. 3rd party apps and Alexa enhancements will continue to make this device even better. Currently, if you need a fire TV or streaming media player in a room I think the FireTV Cube is a no brainer. For most people this will not replace the remote entirely. If you know what you want to watch every time you sit down I think it could easily be done. However, if you are searching for a movie or show to watch the remove is hard to beat. That being said, this does 100% replace the need for both an Alexa and Fire TV in one room and is a brilliant addition to the Alexa line-up.There is room for improvement but since the hardware is all there, I think a little fine-tuning over the next few months from Amazon will turn this into a must have 5-star product for everyone.Included:Fire TV Cube15W Power adapterStandard black controller with voice controlEthernet adapter (if you don’t want to use wi-fi connection”IR sensor extenderVarious manuals and quick install guides" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

That’s why I preordered and was excited for the first updated FireTV in two years. Needless to say this was a huge disappointment and marketed completely wrong by Amazon.As an “upgraded” version of the FireTV, this device fails in almost every way possible...Internal components - FAILExternal option features - FAILOS6 Firware - FAIL (not ready for initial release)Amazon removed the built in ethernet attachment and instead makes you purchase an ethernet accessory dongle if you want the option to hard wire the internet. They removed the microSD slot, removing the possibility of expanding the memory for additional apps, games, or playing digital content that you already own. They also removed the USB option for a keyboard, mouse, or hard drive.Looking at the specs the processor is actually slower, and the 4k capability is only SLIGHTLY improved over the FireTV2. After two years of design the only display difference was to upgrade 4k from 30fps to 60fps. The older version feels faster and loads videos and apps quicker than this device also.The OS6 is still glitchy and had trouble loading your apps on the homepage and the 'My Apps page. I'm sure the OS will receive updates to fix these issues, but should have been done before the release.Yes the price is cheaper than the old version, but you are definitely purchasing a lesser product.As I said, if you are looking for an improved FireStick, this is an upgrade.If you are looking for a new or replacement FireTV, stay away or wait for the (rumored) FireTV cube." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Echo (2nd Generation) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal Fabric" review=" My mother is 84 years old and she struggles talking on a cell phone, and I struggle to hear her. She kept bumping the cell phone up against her chin, and when I talked to her I hear numerous beeps when we are talking like someone was dialing out. She is having trouble holding the cell phone up to her head. I talked my mom in to getting an Amazon Echo as a gift from me. My sister helped to set it up since I am in another state. When you make a call with the Echo, it uses the phone number associated with the cell phone that is on your Amazon account. So I changed that to my mothers cell number. So when she makes a call, it shows up as her cell phone number on the Caller ID. Now all she has to do is say Alexa call Greg, and the Echo dials me up, and anyone in her contact list. She rests comfortably in her easy chair, and she can hear everything I say through the Echo, and I can hear everything my mother says very clearly. She can also ask Alexa to dial any number, that is very helpful as well. This feature alone was well worth the price of buying an Amazon Echo. My mother is learning very quickly all the other skills Alexa is able to do, weather, music, audiobooks, trivia questions, etc. Now that I am able to talk to my mother with ease.I would have to say this is the BEST gadget I have ever bought on Amazon.Attached is a Voice Mail from my mother, and how much she LOVES the Amazon Echo" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Get the paperwhite with no ads. You're welcome.LONG REVIEWI love physical books too, I'm with you. But I know myself, and I know that once I forget to take the book I'm reading with me, that's it. I'll start another book and rarely finish the first. I also know if I try and read on my phone or iPad that I'll get distracted and start wondering about what's happening on the internet (Instagram's not gonna scroll ITSELF). Either way I'm not finishing the book.WHY KINDLEThe kindle takes the best of both worlds and mashes them together. The e ink display is honestly incredible. I wish iPhones had an e ink display. It really looks just like a printed page. So you get the experience of reading a physical paper book, but with the perks of being digital.Namely:- Share what book you're reading to Goodreads, Facebook, or twitter (so you can look SMORT)- Built in dictionary (so you can learn the proper spelling of the word SMORT)- Export your highlights as a PDFPlus, it'll also sync with the kindle app on your phone so you can squeeze in the final few pages of the chapter while you're in the bathroom (don't pretend you don't do that. You're either on your phone or you're reading the febreeze ingredients)READING IN BEDThe backlight looks great. It's a perfect size. And because it's one page at a time, you overcome another annoyance of physical books: you can read laying down in bed without the awkward I just need to hold the book weird like this for a second while I finish the left page, then I'll be on the right page and can relax situation. It's great.LIBRARY BOOKSYou can check out library books digitally without leaving your house. And yes, you can make highlights and export those as a PDF (to answer your next question, yes, you could technically highlight the whole book, but that would take more time than it's worth).ADS OR NAH?Get the one without ads. Remember the problem with reading on your phone? Distractions. Why would you buy a device that ONLY does one thing exceptionally well (isolated reading) and then ruin the experience with ads about products you should buy? Now you're thinking about oh right, I gotta get my oil changed or what am I gonna make for dinner? instead of whether Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are really ever going to get together.WHICH MODEL?And no, you don't need a more expensive kindle. This one works great and the other ones don't give you much more for the money. Get the wifi only model (please, you're REALLY going to use the 3G to download books on the go? Get real).And yes, this is the best e-reader out there. Come on, it's Amazon. ANY book you want is a few taps away.WHAT YOU WANTKindle Paperwhite (wifi only, cuz really, you're gonna use 3G??) with no ads.You're furiggin welcome." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa, 7" Display, 8 GB, Black - with Special Offers" review=" Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. It’s still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and it’s such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7” model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7” 8 or 16 GB; 8” 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8” model is $10 cheaper--- the 7” model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7” model). Note that the Kids edition is only sold with the higher storage (7” – 16 GB; 8” – 32 GB)--- both models can use up to 256 GB microSDXC expansion storage (previously max 128 GB for 7”)--- both models offer Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant at the touch of a button--- both models are physically the same size as previously but slightly lighter – the 8” has lost 1 oz of weight, the 7” is 0.6 oz lighter- BOTH 7” and 8” MODELS are suitable for:--- web surfing using Amazon’s Silk browser--- watching streaming movies or TV shows **--- listening to music **--- reading Kindle books (the 7” is roughly the same size as a Kindle)--- playing games and other apps (within the limitation of Amazon's own ecosystem)--- Kid use – both offer the ability to set up child accounts with restricted access--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- IN ADDITION, THE 8” FIRE HAS:--- slightly larger and higher quality display (but I found both displays to be essentially equivalent in quality)--- larger standard storage (16 GB vs 8 GB)--- better sound – Dolby audio, stereo (7” has mono speaker) **--- larger battery / longer life between charges (Amazon states up to 12 hours, vs up to 8 hrs for the 7”)--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- WHAT DON’T THEY DO AND WHAT ARE THEIR LIMITATIONS?--- Neither model will display 1080p video--- camera specs are poor compared to most current phone and higher priced tablets, so don’t expect high resolution photos--- Sound quality and volume ability is a limitation - see next paragraph--- With limited built in storage, they both rely upon the expansion slot to store larger amounts of photos, videos, or music. Responsiveness using memory from the expansion slot is not quite the same as with a tablet that has greater hard wired storage built-in--- All Fire models are limited to using Amazon’s own Silk web browser, which is less flexible than the regular Chrome or Firefox browsers that can be used on regular Android or Apple tablets- THE SOUND QUALITY AND MAXIMUM VOLUME CAPABILITY IS A WEAK POINT--- Accepting the fact that these are very low cost tablets, they do offer the ability to listen to videos and music and so the built-in speakers will be relied upon by many users. In my opinion the most significant difference between these two Fire models, aside from the screen size, is the difference in sound quality. But I first want to say that neither model has the ability to provide much volume of sound, even at the very highest setting. This is a disappointment.--- The 7 Fire has a single speaker located on the rear of the device, near the bottom. It is weak and produces a very low quality sound. Also, depending on how you are holding the tablet, or if you're using a case to hold it in landscape or portrait mode, the speaker could be covered and even further muffled.--- The 8 HD Fire has better quality sound - two stereo speakers located on the side, positioned so that they will be at the top when the tablet is supported in landscape mode. It also has better sound processing ('Dolby Atmos'), and the sound quality is noticeably better than the 7. Still, the maximum volume capability is modest.--- Bottom line - if you plan to use either model for listening to music or videos, then ear pods or headphones or an external speaker is probably going to be necessary in order to get satisfactory sound. Sound quality is not going to be something owners of these small Fire tablets will be bragging about.- MY IMPRESSIONS OF BOTH MODELS AND HOW THEY COMPAREI purchased both models and illustrate them side by side in my video. They’re obviously very similar in feel and appearance, and the quality is excellent. I also like the matching Amazon cases that protect the screen when not in use and prop the tablet in either landscape or portrait orientation to make it easy to set it on a table to read or watch videos. The cases work exactly the same for both sizes.The display is the most obvious difference – not only size, but the slightly greater display content and resolution. At least that is what the Amazon specs suggest, but to my eyes they are both pretty much the same. I did find that the 7 model seemed to have a slightly brighter display, and the 'whiteness' of the display also seemed to be better.The other difference I wanted to evaluate was the sound quality, since the 7 model has only a single speaker and the 8 model has two (stereo) speakers with Dolby sound processing. For anyone using this tablet for watching videos or listening to music, I thought that would be an important difference.What I found, as also mentioned elsewhere in this review and with respect to the sound quality, was that the limited volume ability of the built-in speakers makes ear pods or headphones or the use of an external speaker almost mandatory. If those considerations are acceptable, then the higher price of the 8 model is probably well worthwhile for users who will use the table very much to listen to music or videos.For reading Kindle books or those who prefer the smaller and lighter size, the 7” model is just great (either model is fine, really).By comparison, the latest small iPad mini has a 7.0” display and is roughly between the 7” and 8” Fire tablets in size (width and height), quite a bit thinner, and about the same weight as the 7” Fire. It’s considerably more powerful and has 128 GB storage standard, but think about it – you can purchase eight 7” Fire tablets for the price of a single iPad mini today! That is really a striking difference.FURTHER THOUGHTSThese two models are the 7th generation Amazon Fire tablet – the first generation was introduced in November, 2011 as the Kindle Fire, offering the same screen size and resolution but a considerably less powerful processor, and selling for $199. Along the way they’ve offered models of various sizes and specifications, and for a short time (generations 3 and 4) their Fire models included the more sophisticated (and expensive) Fire HDX model that may have been intended to be a more direct competitor to Apple’s iPad.Then, in September 2015, Amazon introduced the $49.99 Fire 7, and since that time it seems that they’ve been happy to offer these bargain priced tablets that do everything that most people really need on a day-to-day basis. They make great Kids tablets, too, particularly the ‘Kids Edition’ models that come with the more protective case and 2-year replacement guarantee, just in case your kid drops it in the, ah, swimming pool or some such!WARRANTYThe standard warranty for both Fire models is a short 90-days. Longer warranties - 1, 2 or 3 years - are available at extra cost ($10.99, $14.99, $16.99 respectively). Compared to most devices this is a very short standard warranty.CAMERA QUALITYBoth Fire models have a 2 MP rear-facing 'HD' camera, and a 'VGA' front-facing 0.3 MP camera. These are very mediocre cameras compared to just about any smart phone or tablet currently available and anyone wanting to take photos or videos with their tablet is not going to be satisfied with the quality that can be obtained from these Fire models, but they do suffice if all you want is to take a photo to make a visual note of something for future reference.INCLUDED ACCESSORIESBoth fire models include a 5W wall charger and a VERY SHORT USB cable (just over 3 ft long).As with pretty much all Amazon Fire and Kindle models these days, you can purchase either of these tablets either with or without ‘special offers’. The $15 difference in price eliminates the ads that show when the screen is locked (but disappear when unlocked).For anyone who wants a smaller and lighter weight tablet, these Fire models have become the logical choice. The prices are now so low that they can be a casual purchase for many people, not quite disposable but something easy to pass on when the next new model comes out.I will continue to add more details here as I use these tablets more and have thoughts and comments to share." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Echo Show - Black" review="I know that many media folks have stated that the Drop-in feature of the Echos is creepy and can see their point.  Here's a different perspective.  Mom is now almost 95 and she has short term memory dementia, she's in great spirits but I really can't teach her anything technical, like dialing a phone or even pressing a memory dial button.  She lives near my sister and is 2 hours away so visiting is always a bit of a project.I thought I'd try setting a Show next to her rocking chair.  I can now Drop-in on her every day and share some face time with her, visit with her grand daughter, see the dog whom she LOVES, and just make her smile.  The beauty is that there is no interaction needed on her end, the Caregivers and my Mom love this setup.  The fact that I can use my phone from anywhere and actually see and talk to Mom, and show her things  is hugely entertaining and comforting for Mom, and everyone in the family.So I say with extreme gratitude, Thank You Amazon for creating an amazingly personally helpful tool for the elderly.Personally I am enjoying all of the other great features of an Alexa with a screen, using her with my Arlo Cameras, etc. It truly is quite an amazing platform!  In my office I added a small Pioneer bookshelf stereo, I can be listening to Spotify, Pandora etc and say Alexa, connect Bluetooth, the Pioneer stereo is Bluetooth enabled, it can be OFF and with that single voice command, the Show will wake up the Pioneer, and begin playing the sound over its speakers with no other intervention from me!  This is magical stuff!The only bug I have at the moment, Alexa, turn off the screen, the screen turns off, then immediately turns back on.  Tell her again and the screen stays off, pretty consistent bug.  Edit- Seems fixed now!1/06/2018 Still enjoying my Echo Shows very much, I don't expect this to replace a tablet, it does many things very well, besides being indispensable with visiting Mom.  Currently there is one in the Kitchen and it is used by the family to play lots of music, having the screen is really nice to be able to see what's playing etc.  We are trying Amazon Music and so far it's pretty sweet as well, Alexa show me all albums from Keith Urban, up comes pictures of all of his 12 or so album covers, touch one and play the album.  Alexa, Connect Bluetooth and the Show connects to a Bluetooth receiver I have on our whole house stereo.  Alexa Turn on the Stereo, Alexa controls the Logitech Harmony remote to power up the stereo and now we are hearing music everywhere, nice.We've also added some Ring cameras and doorbell, Alexa, show me the front door, now I'm looking out front.Oh, and our doggie monitor/treat shooter, Furbo, Alexa, ask Furbo to toss a treat is our dog Cookie 's favorite skill!Bottom line, this is a very powerful system, don't get me wrong we love our Apple products (Phones, iPads, and Macs)  but I prefer this Amazon ecosystem for my home music, automation, and general questions etc. as it's a fairly open system that plays well with 3rd parties when compared to the likes of Apple.I would never have imagined all that is possible with these units!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I was first expecting to pay $100, but was pleasantly surprised by the pricing and reviews for these.I just now tested these, and to me, they don't seem too bad.  The audio quality is lesser than the Beats he was using, but to me, that's OK.  They are not as comfortable as the Beats either, but they're still fine for wearing for hours on end.Unfortunately, they were not acceptable for my teenage son.  This was just one gift of the many for his birthday.  We tend to go overboard, even before Christmas.  He wasn't overly thrilled, but used them immediately.  Later, in a fit of rage over his other gifts, he shouts Thanks for the $10 scratchy headset Dad!.So, if you're a middle age person looking for good value, I think these are a good fit.  Though, if you're a spoiled brat teenage boy who wants to hear what others will do to his mom in the best sound quality and comfortability, these may not be the best purchase." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Wyze Cam 1080p HD Indoor Wireless Smart Home Camera with Night Vision, 2-Way Audio, White" review="I want to begin by saying that I have been very interested in owning security cameras in my home, but I've never wanted to spend a bunch of money on it. I heard about this camera through a tech news article and I thought that I would give it a shot. After all, a $30 1080p security camera with some free cloud storage just seemed to good to be true.What I like:Picture quality is very good and setup was easy. Priced very well too!Each camera comes with a metal plate and some sticky tape which allows you to put this on any flat surface. This is nice since the camera has a magnet on the bottom of the stand.Updates come out regularly to fix bugs. Hope that continues for many years to come!The two way audio quality is actually pretty good! Talking to someone is kind of a pain though. Speaking of that...What I don't like:To have your voice protrude through a camera, you have to open the camera on the app and press and hold the mic icon. To hear the other person though, you have to unmute the camera. Seems sensible so far right? Well every time you tap that mic icon, the camera mutes itself again. Kinda pointless to advertise two way audio if the person on the app has to constantly unmute the camera in order to hear the person on the camera trying to talk to them. Not sure why it wont stick to the setting I choose.The recorded alerts are too short. For instance, I have a camera setup in my garage to start recording after it detects sound or motion. Whenever the garage door is opening, I get alerted and the camera starts recording. However, the recording lasts just long enough to see the garage door open and nothing else as recordings are between 9-12 seconds long. There appears to be a cooldown between each alert too. I say this because I don't get another alert in the time it takes me to park the car, close the garage door, get out of the car, and walk across the camera to get into my home. Having a microSD to continuously record everything would circumvent this, but having the ability to have recorded alerts be 30 seconds could avoid this whole issue.You can now setup times as to when the camera will send you alerts, but unfortunately these options are just limited to time of day and do not include day of the week. So if you were hoping to set it up to alert you Monday through Friday between the times of 7am and 4pm, you couldn't. This will always alert you every day of the week between your specified times.This is a small complaint, but the app saves an image of the thumbnail for each camera directly on my phone. I'd prefer the thumbnails to stay on the app itself and not saved in its own folder in my pictures. This also goes for my avatar picture on the app.Summary:This is a fantastic security camera for the money. Most of my problems are software related and (hopefully) will be fixed soon. I look forward to updating my review after they get some more options added and address some of the issues that I mentioned above.Update: 1/3/18Both of my cameras frequently disconnect and require power cycles in order to get them to work. They may work for a few hours or a day if I am lucky. Also alarm notifications are not coming up until I open the app making the alerts almost worthless. I'll wait again for an update, but I'm kinda losing hope here.Update: 2/20/2018They pushed out an update to help fix the frequent disconnects that I was experiencing, but now only one camera seems to work consistently at a time. (This is in regards to live streaming) What happens is I always seem to have one camera fail at random while the other one continues to work fine. As soon as I power cycle the camera that isn't working, the other one goes down in about a day and I cannot connect to it anymore. If I power cycle that one, then other one goes down. This has been going on since my last update and I now only power cycle them if Wyze pushes out an update as it gets old having to power cycle them every other day. I still get notifications on the one that happens to be down, so it's just the live streaming that doesn't work.Speaking of notifications, if you are on an Android device and are not receiving notifications from the app, try disabling any battery optimization settings (i.e. Doze) that are interacting with the app. Disabling that should make the notifications come up again. My phone recently updated to have the Doze feature in Android 8.0 and disabling those settings seems to have made those work again." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I initially suspected something wrong with the fan until my wife realized the power strip was actually arcing behind the dresser. We immediately turned the breaker off and realized that if we hadn’t been home a fire could have started and caused significant damage to the house/burnt the house down. I will look into having the power strip inspected and consider legal options at this point. Extremely disappointed in Amazon and I am still shocked thinkin about what could have happened if this happened a few hours later in the day, when no one is home...It seems that this device will NOT fail safely - this is absolutely unacceptable" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Roku Streaming Stick+ | 4K/HDR/HD streaming player with 4x the wireless range & voice remote with TV power and volume" review="I have used Roku for years,including several different models.The best new thing of note is Roku has recently released The Roku Channel,which has hundreds of free movies.It is ad supported.Roku has just about every app you can imagine (YouTube/Pandora/Netflix/Amazon/Hulu/HBO Now) and thousands of more apps in many different categories.This Roku Streaming Stick PLUS does have more advanced WiFi antenna than the regular Streaming Stick.Here are some points to consider when deciding on which model of Roku to buy:1)If you need to connect by WiFi in a room far away from your WiFi router,I would recommend the Roku Streaming Stick PLUS or Roku Ultra.2)If you have a 4K TV,I would recommend the Roku Ultra or Roku Streaming Stick PLUS.3)To search for content using your voice,go with either the Streaming Stick,Streaming Stick PLUS or Ultra.All 3 of these models also have a remote that can control the power and volume on a TV.4)If you want a wired ethernet connection,go with the Roku Ultra.5)If you want to connect to an old TV with RCA/Composite audio/video jacks,you will need the Express PLUS6)The Express models have a remote where it has to be pointed at the device,unlike the other Roku models.7)If you are only going to buy one Roku device,I would recommend the Roku Ultra.The Ultra has many unique features that the other Roku models don't such as:-Gaming buttons to play video games-Remote finder to find a lost remote control-Ethernet port for a wired connection-Micro SD card slot-USB Port-Night listening mode (this lowers the volume of loud,explosive sounds and raises the volume of soft sounds like whispers.Very useful!)-Headphone jack on the remote for listening without disturbing othersFor those who have not used a Roku before,here are some tips that might be helpful:1)There is no monthly fee to use a Roku.There are many free channels/apps with free movies,music and TV programs and some people use Roku only for the free channels and do not pay any fees.You do NOT have to enter credit card info if you only wish to view free content and you can always add credit card info to your account later  for paid channels/apps.If you plan on viewing free content only,I suggest setting up a Roku account before you activate the device.When you reach the page to enter credit card info,some browsers will show a Skip,I'll add later option at the bottom.If you do not see this option,simply log out of your account,then log back in.You may have to then enter a different activation code for your device if you skip  entering credit card info during device set up,but you do NOT have to enter credit card info if you only want to view free content.2)Some of the most popular free channels/apps are: YouTube,Pandora radio,The Roku Channel,Pluto TV,Tubi TV,Crackle,CBS News,NBC News,ABC,PBS, PBS KIds and many more.You can also find a free live stream of FOX News on YouTube by searching Fox News Live on YouTube.3)Some of the most popular paid channels/apps are Netflix,Hulu,Amazon video,HBO Now,Vudu,Sling TV,Spectrum TV and Direct TV Now.4)If you are looking for a bundle of channels of live TV to replace cable TV,check out Sling TV,Spectrum TV,Direct TV Now,Hulu,Pluto TV and Playstation Vue.All of these are paid services except for Pluto TV,which is free.5)To find and add new channels on Roku,just press the Home button on the remote control,scroll down and select Streaming Channels.There you will find thousands of channels/apps in many different categories and many of them are free.My one gripe about Roku (and other streaming devices) is the lack of a fully functional web browser and I hope Roku will include web browsing on models in the near future.I have been surfing the web on the big screen for years and find it ridiculous when an internet connected TV device does not allow you to surf the internet and forces one to switch to yet another internet connected device to do so.I am aware of the screen mirroring function from smartphone/PC/tablet but find that a poor excuse to not include a web browser.People who type a lot of messages and/or emails like myself much prefer typing on a wireless keyboard rather than a phone/tablet/remote control." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have always one for other options thinking that the Kindle Fire was not what I wanted. I was very,  very wrong.  This next generation of  tablets are amazing!It has about 12 hours battery life, it has  many settings that you can use to save your battery by going off Wifi if you don't need it. It is an 8 inch HD display,  it has a quad core processor, 1.3 gigahertz. It it has 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal storage, and a MicroSD slot for up to 256GB.  So you really have a lot of storage! It is so well made, I was surprised,  because  I have three other tablets which take forever to open. The Amazon Fire comes on instantly. You push the on button and it's on. It also contains 'Alexa',  which will be really helpful in accessing information and entertainment.  You can ask questions, play music,  check your calendar,  you can get news,  and weather,  and so much more.  Just press the home button and ask 'Alexa'.  You can enjoy hundreds of movies,  TV shows,  songs,  Kindle ebooks you can even have a text- to-speech narrator,  who will read the book to you! How AWESOME is that?  I can't say enough about this tablet.  I love it.  It has Netflix,  Facebook,  HBO and Spotify. Prime members get unlimited access to so many things at no additional cost. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!  It seems to have brought us into a different venue.  if not just a tablet anymore,  it now has Alexa and she'll show you how to navigate through this tablet. From one app to another just by speaking. It comes in a variety of colored covers. But this is not a tablet case.  If you want a tablet that is completely covered,  front and back,  you will have to buy a case separately. The case that comes with your Kindle Fire is just the back side of the case it does not cover the front. [...] Thank you for reading my review." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

We have a 2 story home and a finished basement.  Prior to googles mesh system I had to have two routers to get a decent signal throughout my home.  I tried extenders but they were worthless.  I had to have several wireless networks setup.  So you would have to switch networks if you wanted a decent signal in the basement.  Once I hooked up this system I had a strong signal from top to bottom of my house.  You will notice the difference in internet speeds in my picture once I switched over to google wifi (June 14).People have complained about loss of flexibity and tweaking since they have to use their phone to configure the google network.  I have no issues with doing anything I did prior to using this.  I work from home and connect to my employer via VPN with no issues.  I can view network traffic, turn off internet for the kids and see how many devices are connected at the click of a button on my phone.  No longing into the router from my desktop or my phones tiny browser.  When you walk from one level to the next, I can see which google router I am connected to.  It automatically switches to the closest one as advertised." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

There are so many positives to mention. First, cut the cable and stream only with Roku, save money, and only pay for what you want. Get rid of the Tivo, Cable box, etc that use mechanical hard drives which always fail, slow, and cost extra each month for cable cards or cable company DVR. The Roku's are much smaller. They are super-fast at loading channels like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc. Our Tivo was a slug, made noise, prone to crashing. None of these problems exist with the Roku. The one we use most upstairs has crashed a few times, in the almost year we have owned it. Simple unplug and let it reload. The reload time is about 2-3 minutes unlike the Tivo DVR which was 15+ minutes. You will want to invest in rechargeable batteries, as I replace mine every 2 weeks or so. No big deal considering all the benefits. When you purchase a Roku set up is easy and only takes about 15-20 minutes max. No cable company cards for a Tivo, or taking a day off work to meet the cable guy. The newest Roku Ultra even now has options for powering on the your TV and volume. Point at the TV during set up and it learns on its own, super easy. Other DVR remotes in the past you had to look up codes and program your remote. Listen at night with headphones that can plug into the remote. Worried about missing shows? Get the channel Playstation Vue, and record into their cloud and watch your shows when you want. If you’re on the fence, then buy just one, keep your cable box for a time while you use the Roku. Once you see how easy setup is, realize the money saved cancelling cable, see how fast it can load all the hundreds of channels you chose, navigation is intuitive, even my wife after a few months is now hooked on the Roku. So long expensive cable company and noisy, slow, large, crashing DVR's. One more thing, Roku now offers its own channel with lots and lots of free movies, and minimal commercials. Now having owned them for almost a year, reliable, cheaper, faster, easier, intuitive, and many many more options available then a DVR, it's almost too good to be true." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

This one was purchased for my Vizio E-50 TV (50).  The mount comes with everything you need to install for various VESA mount configurations.  What I recommend you use with the install is a stud finder, drill, and associated bit/screw bit.I also installed the Datacomm 50-3323-WH-KIT behind the TV for cable management so that I could run the include 10' HDMI cable and power inside the wall versus having the cables hang down from the TV.  You can't beat this mount for the price; it's sturdy and the viewing angle is adjustable.  Because it's in my bedroom, I do have it an angle, which puts the top of the TV about 4.25 inches from the wall.  Even at this angle, you can't see any of the cables as you enter the room (the include velcro cable management ties work perfectly.Like most Amazon shoppers, I count on honest, unbiased reviews.  I hope you have found this review helpful in making your purchase decision." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

But once opened there were two cables, not cramped or kinked in the package.I was pleased with the length of the cables, they work great in the car without having to wrench the phone around in awkward positions to access the screen.The braided nylon felt great, much stronger than my plastic ones. I'm hoping they will stay kink free and not bend like the plastic ones I have now.I wanted to test the sound quality on these, since I've had problems with cords in the past, and I didn't notice any cracking or sound distortion. They worked well with my iPhone and with my son's Samsung as well.So, so far so good. I hope they work out as anticipated because I'll be buying more." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="TCL 55S405 55-Inch 4K Ultra HD Roku Smart LED TV (2017 Model)" review="Here's the short version:If you grew up poor and can't mentally justify spending a month of rent in urban California on a single television, if you're poor as heck right now but could conceivably afford this television, if you've never owned a 4k TV, if you've never owned an especially large TV, you will not be disappointed by this gigantic freaking monstrosity of a display. It nicely upscales 1080p content, it has a nice frame rate, it has passable speakers you can hear the bass on, and as someone who is picky about delay to the point of 25ms being effectively unusable for music-based games I am very happy with the game mode option that removes the delay typically associated with HDMI displays. It is a good TV and everyone in my family, which includes two audio people and a visual artist, is extremely happy with it.The detailed version:Given the extremely low cost compared to similarly sized TVs it is surprisingly high quality.The remote is minimal, comfortable, and easy to use.Has a phone app in case you're one of the many people who habitually misplace the remote. App does exactly the same things the remote does.The speakers kinda suck at low volumes, but it's whatever. If you care about audio quality go buy some fancy external hookups. It's good enough that I can bump the Thumper soundtrack and it's still a decent listening quality. Actually plays tones below 200Hz and does so cleanly, so it's better than most TVs I've had.It has a game mode that it claims will affect the picture quality, but does not noticeably do, and the lack of delay is such that it is not noticeable to me, a musician to whom 25ms of delay is unacceptably bad and unusable. I'm actually able to play Thumper on the Nintendo Switch with no problems whereas with my previous TV it was so bad that I opted instead to play on console with headphones. This is the feature that I love the most about this TV.The upscaling is such that on my gaming PC I saw no difference between 4k and 1080p when playing GTA5 (except for the frame rate when large distances or a large number of objects are visible, which is entirely due to the fact that I'm playing it on a GTX1060).It has a lot of service integrations, such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, Google Play Movies, and a few others.IT'S HUGE OH MY GOD I AM BAD AT CONCEPTUALISING PHYSICAL SPACE I DID NOT REALISE HOW BIG FIFTY-FIVE INCHES IS EVEN WHEN ESTIMATING ITS SIZE BASED ON MY EXISTING 40 TELEVISION I LITERALLY HAD TO REARRANGE MY ENTIRE ROOM AND BUILD NEW FURNITURE TO ACCOMMODATE THIS THING???????It's surprisingly thin.Does CEC and has settings to automatically switch channels based on what just turned on.Lots of options for controlling and customising various aspects of the television including picture and audio correction, accessibility options including captions and spoken audio transcription (I have not tested the latter feature), and UI skins. You should absolutely poke around the options as much as possible once you get this as there are several options for things like the refresh rate of the display, which I imagine is relevant to a lot of people. (I am not intimately familiar with specifics of refresh rates, but I have seen no tearing or distortion from fast-motion visuals and things appear to animate smoothly.)Does some advertising for purchasing media through Roku, presumably to offset the cost of the device. It isn't especially intrusive and only consists of movie posters in a small portion of the screen at very select times in one part of one menu.Does require a significant amount of opting out of certain things.Overall a fantastically huge, featureful, and good-looking TV for the cost.Regarding complaints I've seen in other reviews: My product did not show up broken, it has not stopped working despite extensive use since I got it, I have no complaints about the refresh rate, it displays 4k content over HDMI with no issues, they say it's a glossy screen but it's really just unusually and disconcertingly smooth and otherwise significantly less glareful and reflective than my previous television, it has effectively no inconsistencies with backlighting or colour (just a small spot that's slightly brighter, which is only visible at extreme viewing angles or if the screen is effectively displaying nothing but black, and I don't mean like really dark or a scene at night I mean like literally it is displaying the colour black over 50% of the screen, and only then is it noticeable from a front angle, and just barely at that).So if you're one of those folks that buys artisan gold plated audio cables aged seven years in oaken casks, if you buy two of the Ti version of the latest nVidia graphics card because you absolutely need to run everything on Ultra at 120FPS in 4k, if you're the kind of person who thinks Grey Goose tastes better, you probably won't like this TV.If 10% not as good as the best thing for 1/4 of the cost is your jam, this is an amazing purchase. I freaking love my new giant TV." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

However, these are fantastic for me. I work in an open office environment and sometimes the level of noise spikes from ambient to distracting to intolerable (you know how there's always that one person in the office louder than everybody else? I sit next to five of them). The very first day, my colleague and I looked at each other and nodded, it's time for noise cancelling headphones - so I did some research, read some reviews, and bought two Cowin E-7's for us.Having never tried active noise cancelling before, I have to say I'm impressed (my coworker didn't like it, as the noise cancelling made her feel queasy, but that's not Cowin-specific, just the technology in general doesn't agree with her). For me, it puts a strong damper on the background noise. Now if people are talk-yelling loudly, of course I can still hear them, which is great because if someone yells FIRE! I'd like to know about it. But I'm streaming my Boston sports radio and my Pearl Jam and clacking away while my noisy keyboard to get some revenge to those who don't have noise-cancelling headphones like these.Two quick notes which I hope are helpful. 1.) When using it for Skype (the mic works great by the way) or GoToMeeting, Wiindows 10 might identify it as a communications device rather than the proper stereo headphones. I almost returned these because the sound was so scratchy, especially on music. Thankfully I read another reviewer's comment who identified the issue and how to solve it - it's a Windows thing - you just have to right-click your speaker icon, go to Playback Devices, and make sure the Stereo listing of the E-7 is the default device and the default communications device. Then you'll get the full benefit and the excellent sound quality these headphones provide.The second is, if  you're like my coworker and don't want noise-cancelling - and buy noise-cancelling headphones for some reason, even though there is a standard pair $10 cheaper right next to it - it's an optional feature you can switch on or off as needed. Sometimes I'll turn it off if it's not noisy in the office, and it still sounds great. Like other headphones with this technology, they can be a bit bulky, but actually they are light and quite comfortable for long use.So overall, I am very happy with this purchase and don't have any negatives to say about it. Do they compare to the more expensive brands? I can't really answer that, but I also can't imagine those brands being so much better that they justify the cost. These work, and they sound great. That's all I need!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Roku Streaming Stick | Portable, power-packed player with voice remote with TV power and volume" review="I have been using Roku for years,including several different models.The best new thing of note is Roku has recently released The Roku Channel,which has hundreds of free movies.It is ad supported.Roku has just about every app you can imagine (YouTube/Pandora/Netflix/Amazon/Hulu/HBO Now) plus thousands of more apps in many different categories.Here are some points to consider when deciding on which model of Roku to buy:1)If you need to connect by WiFi in a room far away from your WiFi router,I would recommend the Roku Streaming Stick PLUS or Roku Ultra.2)If you have a 4K TV,I would recommend the Roku Ultra or Roku Streaming Stick PLUS.3)To search for content using your voice,go with either the Streaming Stick,Streaming Stick PLUS or Ultra.All 3 of these models also have a remote that can control the power and volume on a TV.4)If you want a wired ethernet connection,go with the Roku Ultra.5)If you want to connect to an old TV with RCA/Composite audio/video jacks,you will need the Express PLUS6)The Express models have a remote where it has to be pointed at the device,unlike the other Roku models.7)If you are only going to buy one Roku device,I would recommend the Roku Ultra.The Ultra has many unique features that the other Roku models don't such as:-Gaming buttons to play video games-Remote finder to find a lost remote control-Ethernet port for a wired connection-Micro SD card slot-USB Port-Night listening mode (this lowers the volume of loud,explosive sounds and raises the volume of soft sounds like whispers.Very useful!)-Headphone jack on the remote for listening without disturbing othersFor those who have not used a Roku before,here are some tips that might be helpful:1)There is no monthly fee to use a Roku.There are many free channels/apps with free movies,music and TV programs and some people use Roku only for the free channels and do not pay any fees.You do NOT have to enter credit card info if you only wish to view free content and you can always add credit card info to your account later  for paid channels/apps.If you plan on viewing free content only,I suggest setting up a Roku account before you activate the device.When you reach the page to enter credit card info,some browsers will show a Skip,I'll add later option at the bottom.If you do not see this option,simply log out of your account,then log back in.You may have to then enter a different activation code for your device if you skip entering credit card info during device set up,but you do NOT have to enter credit card info if you only want to view free content.2)Some of the most popular free channels/apps are: YouTube,Pandora radio,The Roku Channel,Pluto TV,Tubi TV,Crackle,CBS News,NBC News,ABC,PBS, PBS KIds and many more.You can also find a free live stream of FOX News on YouTube by searching Fox News Live on YouTube.3)Some of the most popular paid channels/apps are Netflix,Hulu,Amazon video,HBO Now,Vudu,Sling TV,Spectrum TV and Direct TV Now.4)If you are looking for a bundle of channels of live TV to replace cable TV,check out Sling TV,Spectrum TV,Direct TV Now,Hulu,Pluto TV and Playstation Vue.All of these are paid services except for Pluto TV,which is free.5)To find and add new channels on Roku,just press the Home button on the remote control,scroll down and select Streaming Channels.There you will find thousands of channels/apps in many different categories and many of them are free.My one gripe about Roku (and other streaming devices) is the lack of a fully functional web browser and I hope Roku will include web browsing on models in the near future.I have been surfing the web on the big screen for years and find it ridiculous when an internet connected TV device does not allow you to surf the internet and forces one to switch to yet another internet connected device to do so.I am aware of screen mirroring  function from smartphone/PC/tablet but find that a poor excuse to not include a web browser.People who type a lot of messages and/or emails like myself much prefer typing on a wireless keyboard rather than a phone/tablet/remote control." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

There are 4 important points I'd like to make:1) All these years I paid for a 50mbps speed from my cable company. I had an older Netgear from 2009 which has served me well all these years (and still works) but I decided it was time to upgrade. Typically I was getting only 12-17mbps through my wi-fi (for example, to my iPhone6). After getting this Nighthawk Router, I now get 57mbps on the same iPhone. All of my devices are much faster now... PS4, iPhones, iPads, Epson Printer, Baby Monitor, Tablets, Roku 3 box, Roku Streaming Stick, etc...2) Cables .... Please note, one other thing I did in addition to getting this router is that I also bought all new cat6 cables (from Amazon Basics), and that has helped the router to connect well to the cable modem. From the router itself, I have a few wired items (Roku 3 box, PS4, my PC). And note that I tested the Roku 3 box, PS4, and PC wirelessly as well. In all conditions, wired with Cat6 cables and/or wi-fi, this Nighthawk router has delivered the speeds I was missing for years.3) Interface.... Also, I like the interface for setting up and using the router. I like that you get two options of 2.4ghz or 5ghz connection. One thing to keep in mind is that some older devices can only use 2.4g so it is that old device itself that limits the connection speed (not your wi-fi necessarily). Newer devices are 5g capable and can maximize the speed capability.4) Security... I also like the Access Control feature so that you have to permit a device to connect to your wi-fi. For example, when I got a new iPad this Christmas, I logged into my wi-fi network and put in the proper password, but it wouldn't connect to the internet. Then I went to the Netgear interface on my PC and it displayed that the iPad had been blocked (because Access Control is turned on). So then I simply hit a check box to allow the iPad onto my home network, and then it connected.Finally, I am not a tech person, I just try to read up on things to the best of my ability. I hope my review helps some of you.5 STARS" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Get the paperwhite with no ads. You're welcome.LONG REVIEWI love physical books too, I'm with you. But I know myself, and I know that once I forget to take the book I'm reading with me, that's it. I'll start another book and rarely finish the first. I also know if I try and read on my phone or iPad that I'll get distracted and start wondering about what's happening on the internet (Instagram's not gonna scroll ITSELF). Either way I'm not finishing the book.WHY KINDLEThe kindle takes the best of both worlds and mashes them together. The e ink display is honestly incredible. I wish iPhones had an e ink display. It really looks just like a printed page. So you get the experience of reading a physical paper book, but with the perks of being digital.Namely:- Share what book you're reading to Goodreads, Facebook, or twitter (so you can look SMORT)- Built in dictionary (so you can learn the proper spelling of the word SMORT)- Export your highlights as a PDFPlus, it'll also sync with the kindle app on your phone so you can squeeze in the final few pages of the chapter while you're in the bathroom (don't pretend you don't do that. You're either on your phone or you're reading the febreeze ingredients)READING IN BEDThe backlight looks great. It's a perfect size. And because it's one page at a time, you overcome another annoyance of physical books: you can read laying down in bed without the awkward I just need to hold the book weird like this for a second while I finish the left page, then I'll be on the right page and can relax situation. It's great.LIBRARY BOOKSYou can check out library books digitally without leaving your house. And yes, you can make highlights and export those as a PDF (to answer your next question, yes, you could technically highlight the whole book, but that would take more time than it's worth).ADS OR NAH?Get the one without ads. Remember the problem with reading on your phone? Distractions. Why would you buy a device that ONLY does one thing exceptionally well (isolated reading) and then ruin the experience with ads about products you should buy? Now you're thinking about oh right, I gotta get my oil changed or what am I gonna make for dinner? instead of whether Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are really ever going to get together.WHICH MODEL?And no, you don't need a more expensive kindle. This one works great and the other ones don't give you much more for the money. Get the wifi only model (please, you're REALLY going to use the 3G to download books on the go? Get real).And yes, this is the best e-reader out there. Come on, it's Amazon. ANY book you want is a few taps away.WHAT YOU WANTKindle Paperwhite (wifi only, cuz really, you're gonna use 3G??) with no ads.You're furiggin welcome." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

After making the purchase, the product arrived on time and in great condition.  I want to say that I'm a QC manager and have been for many years so it's in my nature to look at, test, move, tweak, twist and try every piece of everything I buy for proper operation and that it works as described/designed.First off, I read a few reviews that a parts list with a very brief description would be nice to accompany this product.  I say the same thing.  You're getting 50 pieces and if you pull them out and count them, you probably aren't going to know if you got all the right pieces or just a handful of the same thing tossed in to complete the package.  I found two straps that I don't know what they would be used for.  I guess trial and error will have to work.The carrying case is made of good quality material with a foam insert, a webbed pouch on the inside, top and the zipper is sewn good.  The items that have elastic work very well.  The head piece has two adjusting buckles and a thin, non-slip surface on the inside that doesn't hurt or catch your hair if not using a hat.  The chest camera holder also has nice elastic with five adjustments on it.  It's easy to put on and make adjustments to the shoulder and midsection straps.  The  chest strap will move some, but that's expected with the types of clothes you wear and your physical appearance.  I'm not an athlete, but it works great and is very comfortable.  The wrist camera holder is soft to the touch.  Has a piece of velco on the inner strap to help get the wrist strap on and then there is a second strap that allows for the strap to tighten.  The camera attachment swivels for any angle and has a button that will lock the camera in place.  Nice feature.  It came with a selfie stick that is about 36+ long with a screw that would screw into the bottom of a regular camera.  The package comes with the adaptor that attaches to your GoPro and the stick.  There is a three leg tripod that works well and can be manipulated to wrap around items that aren't flat, etc.  It too has the attachment that would screw into a camera.  There is also a threaded hole in the handle end of the selfie stick that it can screw onto the tripod to get height on the camera.  There is an attachment that can be attached to handlebars or small diameter tubing.  There are multiple adhesive pieces to attach brackets to hard surfaces.I suggest you check every bolt, nut and attachment to make sure they all work.  All the bolts that came with the product are well made and have the same amount of threads per bolt protruding from the black plastic handle.  I noticed that the nuts that are molded into the different attachments are not all the same depth.  This is going to cause the issue that I'm not happy with and will try to describe what I found because of this.The pieces that have the nuts molded in them and work with the camera and other attachment to get the camera in the angle and position to get the action movies and pictures you're looking for are not all the same depth in the moldings.  Is what happens is when the bolt is placed through the molded piece to screw into the nut, it goes through too far and only allows for 1/2 - 1 thread to secure the piece.  There are two pieces that won't allow for the bolt to catch the threads at all. This is very unacceptable.After working with every bolt and screwing it into every nut, I want to make a finding that will help you, if you purchase this and the company, if they decide to add a parts list and a few operating statements.  I found six pieces that I couldn't get the bolts to screw into.  I tried different bolts and it felt as though the threads were crossed threaded. I finally tried turning the bolts to the left first (like you loosen bolts) until I felt a click.  Then, I turned the bolt to tighten it and those six pieces could be tightened like the rest.  I was thinking seriously about returning this product until I figured that out.  Yes, it takes about 2 seconds longer to get the attachment tightened, but it works and I don't think it warrants returning the item.The items that I do have an issue with and hope the manufacture responds to are the 5 items that will not allow for a secure attachment because the nuts aren't in the molding far enough to catch the threads of the bolts.So, I think this is a good product.  If the manufacturer can get the inconsistencies of the molded nuts fixed so there is a 100% operational satisfaction, I would definitely give this a 5 stars.  Would I recommend this product for purchase, yes, because all the major components work as designed, it was only a few of the smaller pieces that had issues.  There are enough extra pieces in this package that something can be used to get those fabulous pictures and movies you're looking for." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Are. The. BEST.Let me start out this review by saying that I have strange, misshapen alien ears. They may look normal, but I MUST have something going on that other people don't have, because I have never been able to understand how everyone is able to get earbuds to stay in their ears.  My life has been one session after another of buying earbuds, putting them in, and them immediately slipping out.  Some of them can make it as long as a few minutes, but even a smile will push them right out of town.It's annoying.  I have never been able to enjoy wearing anything but enormous over the ear headphones.  Which, while great for sound, are not that great when you're sweaty and at the gym.The kind of all confusing earbuds for me so far have been the Apple ones.  I don't have Airpods, I just have the corded ones that come with the purchase of a phone and/or iPad. These things are slippery all over, and somehow seem to stay in people's ears like a magical sticky geckos.  For me?  No way.  I put them in (I hesitate to say in, I should probably say on considering they just sort of rest there with no other means of gripping), and as soon as they were placed, they just dropped to the floor.  As useless as balancing a spoon on my nose and then trying to run while keeping it in place.Enter EarBuddyz 2.0I stumbled across these while sitting alone at my desk, drinking wine and googling why don't earbuds stay in my ears? for the 1000th time in my life.  There was, of course, no answer to be found.  But I did come across a list of recommended fixes for myself and other people with alien ear affliction.  A link to EarBuddyz was on that list, and I decided to give it a shot, fully expecting them to be yet another failed mockery of my strange deformed cartilage layout.They arrived and were easy to maneuver onto the Apple earpods.  And I flicked them up into my ears.OH SWEET MERCIFUL GODS.THEY.STAYED.IN.I finally know what it's like to be one of crowd.  I can now blend in with the normals and no one knows about my alien ear mutation, because I now also have magical sticky ear geckos of my own.I can run in them, I can sweat with them.  I have accidentally pulled on the cord while running and they have STAYED PUT like the glorious little amphibious soldiers that they are.If you are one of my fellow sufferers, I sure hope these work for you as well as they have worked for me.  I have two pair and couldn't be happier with them.  If anything ever happens to them, I completely plan on buying more.  If I could give them ten stars, I would." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

But it is perfect as a low-cost secondary display for a laptop. I work from home frequently, and my little laptop screen wasn't cutting it to connect to the bigger dual-monitor display setup I have on my desk at work. I needed something that was fairly inexpensive, but would be easy on the eyes when I'm coding for work. I bought it along with a VESA adapter and a mounting arm, because I like to put my secondary displays in portrait mode, and the stand it comes with doesn't do that. Color and resolution seem pretty good. The back light is nice. There's a tiny bit of light bleed around the edge of mine, but I use it in a fully lit room during daytime hours, so it's not bothersome. I do wish that the place you put the VESA adapter or stand was more centered, because the monitor is a little wobbly, even on the arm I have it mounted on. Otherwise, it's a solid monitor considering I only paid $100 for it. If you're looking for some fancy display for watching high definition movies and playing games, maybe this isn't it. But if you need a second or third monitor for internet browsing / writing code / basic stuff, this is a good choice." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Figured out how to set recurring and different alarms for weekdays and weekends (after you set the 'single alarm' go to the alexa app under alarms and reminders - you have far more control through the app to easily change that single alarm into a recurring alarm with lots of options). Got a photo uploaded to make a custom clock face (used my photo cloud storage at Prime). Played some Prime music. Watched a little CNN. What isn't to love???THE FONT SIZE!!!!!It can't be that hard to give us options on font size on the 'personalized' clock. Hey, Amazon developers, not all of us have perfect eyesight, especially at night when the eyeglasses end up on the night stand next to the Spot. Listen to the nearsighted of America, heck, the World, give us a bigger font!!!!!As soon as Amazon addresses this 'you gotta be kidding' fix, I will be changing that 4 star review to a 5!!!Edit:They listened!!!There is now a much bigger font, very similar to what I photoshopped in my ‘wish’ photo, and it can turn red at night. A++ and I changed my rating to five stars. I really like this little spot, we have been buying more Alexa compatible items and our ‘smart home’ is really coming together.And for all of my ‘commentors’ who suggested just asking Alexa what time it is, I would rather not wake up my guy in the middle of the night." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Since the price difference between a 128gb SD and a 256gb SD is about $100, I went with the 128. I use this away from home since it is a lot smaller and lighter than my laptops. This is a lot better than using your cell phone1. The customer service both phone and chat is outstanding.2. The Alexa set up is better than it is on the Generation 5.3. I would suggest that you go to “Settings” and the “Help”. An excellent manual is available in “Help”.4. If you are new to the Fire HD 10, Take your time picking out your aps and delete the one that didn’t work out the way you want.5. The screen size is fine and very clear.6. If you have Alexa play music while you work on something on the Fire, you will find that the battery charge will drop faster. For you senior citizens, I am 83 years old and have no trouble using this unit." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

We are Apple users, everything in my house and office are Apple but seriously when I went to the Apple store Ro buy an iPad  I just felt it was sooo much money for a gadget that my kids throw everywhere, sit on top, etc...so I decided to do some research and found the Amazon Fire 8 kids version to be an interesting option. For the price of one iPad mini I could get 2 Fire HD8 and still save money, so I was like “I’ll try”. Seriously, as soon as I started setting it up I love how everything was so easy and how they separate the content that will be displayed to each kid based on age. A lot of free games, tv shows and movies and the best are the Disney ones, my kids love Disney. The content is free for the first year and then you pay $2.99 per month (the price of one single app on the Apple store)On WiFi, you get the whole set of free shows and stuff and for on the go stuff, I downloaded a bunch of tv shows and games for free with my prime membership.My kids would ask for new games all the time for their iPad and now they couldn’t believe their eyes when they saw all that selection available for them.I definitely recommend this product!!!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa, 7" Display, 8 GB, Marine Blue - with Special Offers" review=" Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. It’s still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and it’s such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7” model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7” 8 or 16 GB; 8” 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8” model is $10 cheaper--- the 7” model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7” model). Note that the Kids edition is only sold with the higher storage (7” – 16 GB; 8” – 32 GB)--- both models can use up to 256 GB microSDXC expansion storage (previously max 128 GB for 7”)--- both models offer Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant at the touch of a button--- both models are physically the same size as previously but slightly lighter – the 8” has lost 1 oz of weight, the 7” is 0.6 oz lighter- BOTH 7” and 8” MODELS are suitable for:--- web surfing using Amazon’s Silk browser--- watching streaming movies or TV shows **--- listening to music **--- reading Kindle books (the 7” is roughly the same size as a Kindle)--- playing games and other apps (within the limitation of Amazon's own ecosystem)--- Kid use – both offer the ability to set up child accounts with restricted access--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- IN ADDITION, THE 8” FIRE HAS:--- slightly larger and higher quality display (but I found both displays to be essentially equivalent in quality)--- larger standard storage (16 GB vs 8 GB)--- better sound – Dolby audio, stereo (7” has mono speaker) **--- larger battery / longer life between charges (Amazon states up to 12 hours, vs up to 8 hrs for the 7”)--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- WHAT DON’T THEY DO AND WHAT ARE THEIR LIMITATIONS?--- Neither model will display 1080p video--- camera specs are poor compared to most current phone and higher priced tablets, so don’t expect high resolution photos--- Sound quality and volume ability is a limitation - see next paragraph--- With limited built in storage, they both rely upon the expansion slot to store larger amounts of photos, videos, or music. Responsiveness using memory from the expansion slot is not quite the same as with a tablet that has greater hard wired storage built-in--- All Fire models are limited to using Amazon’s own Silk web browser, which is less flexible than the regular Chrome or Firefox browsers that can be used on regular Android or Apple tablets- THE SOUND QUALITY AND MAXIMUM VOLUME CAPABILITY IS A WEAK POINT--- Accepting the fact that these are very low cost tablets, they do offer the ability to listen to videos and music and so the built-in speakers will be relied upon by many users. In my opinion the most significant difference between these two Fire models, aside from the screen size, is the difference in sound quality. But I first want to say that neither model has the ability to provide much volume of sound, even at the very highest setting. This is a disappointment.--- The 7 Fire has a single speaker located on the rear of the device, near the bottom. It is weak and produces a very low quality sound. Also, depending on how you are holding the tablet, or if you're using a case to hold it in landscape or portrait mode, the speaker could be covered and even further muffled.--- The 8 HD Fire has better quality sound - two stereo speakers located on the side, positioned so that they will be at the top when the tablet is supported in landscape mode. It also has better sound processing ('Dolby Atmos'), and the sound quality is noticeably better than the 7. Still, the maximum volume capability is modest.--- Bottom line - if you plan to use either model for listening to music or videos, then ear pods or headphones or an external speaker is probably going to be necessary in order to get satisfactory sound. Sound quality is not going to be something owners of these small Fire tablets will be bragging about.- MY IMPRESSIONS OF BOTH MODELS AND HOW THEY COMPAREI purchased both models and illustrate them side by side in my video. They’re obviously very similar in feel and appearance, and the quality is excellent. I also like the matching Amazon cases that protect the screen when not in use and prop the tablet in either landscape or portrait orientation to make it easy to set it on a table to read or watch videos. The cases work exactly the same for both sizes.The display is the most obvious difference – not only size, but the slightly greater display content and resolution. At least that is what the Amazon specs suggest, but to my eyes they are both pretty much the same. I did find that the 7 model seemed to have a slightly brighter display, and the 'whiteness' of the display also seemed to be better.The other difference I wanted to evaluate was the sound quality, since the 7 model has only a single speaker and the 8 model has two (stereo) speakers with Dolby sound processing. For anyone using this tablet for watching videos or listening to music, I thought that would be an important difference.What I found, as also mentioned elsewhere in this review and with respect to the sound quality, was that the limited volume ability of the built-in speakers makes ear pods or headphones or the use of an external speaker almost mandatory. If those considerations are acceptable, then the higher price of the 8 model is probably well worthwhile for users who will use the table very much to listen to music or videos.For reading Kindle books or those who prefer the smaller and lighter size, the 7” model is just great (either model is fine, really).By comparison, the latest small iPad mini has a 7.0” display and is roughly between the 7” and 8” Fire tablets in size (width and height), quite a bit thinner, and about the same weight as the 7” Fire. It’s considerably more powerful and has 128 GB storage standard, but think about it – you can purchase eight 7” Fire tablets for the price of a single iPad mini today! That is really a striking difference.FURTHER THOUGHTSThese two models are the 7th generation Amazon Fire tablet – the first generation was introduced in November, 2011 as the Kindle Fire, offering the same screen size and resolution but a considerably less powerful processor, and selling for $199. Along the way they’ve offered models of various sizes and specifications, and for a short time (generations 3 and 4) their Fire models included the more sophisticated (and expensive) Fire HDX model that may have been intended to be a more direct competitor to Apple’s iPad.Then, in September 2015, Amazon introduced the $49.99 Fire 7, and since that time it seems that they’ve been happy to offer these bargain priced tablets that do everything that most people really need on a day-to-day basis. They make great Kids tablets, too, particularly the ‘Kids Edition’ models that come with the more protective case and 2-year replacement guarantee, just in case your kid drops it in the, ah, swimming pool or some such!WARRANTYThe standard warranty for both Fire models is a short 90-days. Longer warranties - 1, 2 or 3 years - are available at extra cost ($10.99, $14.99, $16.99 respectively). Compared to most devices this is a very short standard warranty.CAMERA QUALITYBoth Fire models have a 2 MP rear-facing 'HD' camera, and a 'VGA' front-facing 0.3 MP camera. These are very mediocre cameras compared to just about any smart phone or tablet currently available and anyone wanting to take photos or videos with their tablet is not going to be satisfied with the quality that can be obtained from these Fire models, but they do suffice if all you want is to take a photo to make a visual note of something for future reference.INCLUDED ACCESSORIESBoth fire models include a 5W wall charger and a VERY SHORT USB cable (just over 3 ft long).As with pretty much all Amazon Fire and Kindle models these days, you can purchase either of these tablets either with or without ‘special offers’. The $15 difference in price eliminates the ads that show when the screen is locked (but disappear when unlocked).For anyone who wants a smaller and lighter weight tablet, these Fire models have become the logical choice. The prices are now so low that they can be a casual purchase for many people, not quite disposable but something easy to pass on when the next new model comes out.I will continue to add more details here as I use these tablets more and have thoughts and comments to share." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I've only stuck to those that were packed in with my consoles (cheap, I know.) The high prices of Turtle beaches and the like always turned me off of purchasing one. That was until I saw these. 27.99? Can't go wrong with that. Most would assume that the cheaper the price, the cheaper the quality... Well thats the exact opposite with these.First off these are comfortable as hell. They fit perfectly over my ears, cutting off 90% of the sounds around me and they just feel so good around my ears.They don't feel sore after long sessions either.The audio quality is perfect. Whether its a youtube video or the sounds of war in Battlefield 1, everything sounds crystal clear. Most importantly the bass is booming! The volume control is easy to use and percise.As a added bonus it comes with multiple adapters for other consoles and the like. These headsets are compatible with Xbox one, Ps4, Switch and gaming PCs.I could not be happier with this headset. Comfortable, precise and high quality. What more could you ask for? Especially for the price. Great Product!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I know it is marketed as a tablet stand, but I bought it primarily for my Note 4 phone. It works well for Kindles too. I also use it to hold a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 tablet in portrait mode (keyboard detached).I know, why use a Surface in portrait mode? Because I want to run certain Android apps on this Windows tablet. (This is possible with an Android emulator.) Many Android apps were designed for phone screens in portrait mode. So, hence.  The Surface is awesome, but there's no built-in way to hold the tablet upright in portrait mode. This stand works well for this purpose when putting its arm at a slight, not quite vertical angle. The issue with the Surface in portrait mode on this stand is the center of gravity and where the stand's topmost support point hits the tablet. Normal pressing and tapping and pen usage is just fine. Just test it yourself a bit to get used to how hard you can (and cannot) press at the top of the screen so you don't accidentally tip it over. In landscape mode there are no issues at all (but you probably would just use the Surface's built-in stand)." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="TCL 32S305 32-Inch 720p Roku Smart LED TV (2017 Model)" review="Well, this certainly started out as a 5-star TV. Great price, and our family is a big fan of Roku boxes, having owned two already. Setup was easy and the picture was surprisingly good! All in all, I was very pleased.Until about a week in, I look up while my son is watching a show and there's a vertical line of dead, blue pixels about 7 long running through the middle of the screen, about 5 from the left side. I was hoping it was just a streaming issue with his show, but nope- it was the screen. Really disappointed as a return of a 43 TV, even if they foot the bill (and they should), is going to be a pain.I was hesitant to buy what I consider to be an off-brand, and now I'm wishing I had followed my gut and bought an LG or Samsung. In all fairness to TCL, minus the vertical line it's a really nice TV, and I will update my review accordingly when I hear back from their warranty/service department.UPDATE: TCL tried to pawn the warranty return off on Amazon after I had already started the process with TCL. I told them to stay the course of getting this TV repaired or replaced, and two weeks after the last conversation, NOTHING. Zero communication from TCL. I'm going to give them a couple of more days and then start the process with Amazon to get this replaced. What a hassle. If they turn a corner and make this right I will update this review but as of now I HIGHLY recommend you consider another brand of TV given the quality of this set and, more importantly, the lack of good customer service from TCL.UPDATE #2: I finally emailed TCL at another address and, to their credit, a US-based rep (Larry) showed some interest in making this right. He shipped me a replacement unit and said I could ship the original/defective unit back.After setting up the SECOND unit (wall-mount), updating the software, etc., sat down to watch a movie...more dead pixels. Yep. On the replacement unit, in approximately the same location, there were two lines of dead pixels not unlike the first unit. So again I emailed Larry, and we agreed at this point TCL would just take both units back (on their dime) and refund me my full purchase price. Which they did, and very promptly at that.Before anyone accuses me of sour grapes, TCL-bashing, blah blah blah: Listen, it's a NICE TV! I really wanted to like it! I ended up getting an LG and frankly I like the user interface better on the TCL. But to send me two similarly defective units? Something is horribly wrong with their quality control. Also in fairness to them, their customer service really picked up when Larry got involved (out of CA, I believe). So if you have the time and patience to navigate a return if something goes wrong, I say go for it. It's a nice TV for the price. I just don't have the time to be messing around with returning multiple televisions." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Possible disadvantages are that it works only with the Wyze app as of now.  The Wyze Pan and its fixed counterpart are game changers.  If you don't need a cloud Cam or an outside security cameras these cameras set the bar.  They aren't the best cameras but they are incredible values are as close to zero setup as possible.  Frankly floored by these things.  Buy one to try the worse case is you loose less than $50 and 10 minutes to setup.  If you already have another Wyze camera it will take longer to get out of the box than to get it working.  Great thing for many users. I'm not throwing my other cameras away,  but the other camera makers need to be paying attention." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Unfortunately we didn't notice that the required app had so many permissions, a lot of which were privacy nightmares. Their app requests permission to read your browsing history and bookmarks as well as all the apps you have running on your phone. It can also download whatever it wants whenever it wants. And see your phone calls and logs. After we got this I saw other reviews stating the same thing that were written just after we ordered it. I've seen the company respond but did not like their answers. There is absolutely no reason for this app to need those permissions no matter what they say (and like someone else, I work in IT). I'm always amazed that people blindly install apps without checking permissions, I guess some people just don't care. Which is fine as I understand that it seems like everyone is watching you. But when you have the choice you should choose not to install apps that ask for permissions that obviously aren't needed. (Note: There are a couple more of these reviews that go into greater detail than I did, I urge you to read them before purchasing this item)" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Fire 7 Tablet with Alexa, 7" Display, 8 GB, Punch Red - with Special Offers" review=" Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. It’s still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and it’s such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7” model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7” 8 or 16 GB; 8” 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8” model is $10 cheaper--- the 7” model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7” model). Note that the Kids edition is only sold with the higher storage (7” – 16 GB; 8” – 32 GB)--- both models can use up to 256 GB microSDXC expansion storage (previously max 128 GB for 7”)--- both models offer Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant at the touch of a button--- both models are physically the same size as previously but slightly lighter – the 8” has lost 1 oz of weight, the 7” is 0.6 oz lighter- BOTH 7” and 8” MODELS are suitable for:--- web surfing using Amazon’s Silk browser--- watching streaming movies or TV shows **--- listening to music **--- reading Kindle books (the 7” is roughly the same size as a Kindle)--- playing games and other apps (within the limitation of Amazon's own ecosystem)--- Kid use – both offer the ability to set up child accounts with restricted access--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- IN ADDITION, THE 8” FIRE HAS:--- slightly larger and higher quality display (but I found both displays to be essentially equivalent in quality)--- larger standard storage (16 GB vs 8 GB)--- better sound – Dolby audio, stereo (7” has mono speaker) **--- larger battery / longer life between charges (Amazon states up to 12 hours, vs up to 8 hrs for the 7”)--- ** note comments below regarding sound quality and volume, particularly for the 7 model- WHAT DON’T THEY DO AND WHAT ARE THEIR LIMITATIONS?--- Neither model will display 1080p video--- camera specs are poor compared to most current phone and higher priced tablets, so don’t expect high resolution photos--- Sound quality and volume ability is a limitation - see next paragraph--- With limited built in storage, they both rely upon the expansion slot to store larger amounts of photos, videos, or music. Responsiveness using memory from the expansion slot is not quite the same as with a tablet that has greater hard wired storage built-in--- All Fire models are limited to using Amazon’s own Silk web browser, which is less flexible than the regular Chrome or Firefox browsers that can be used on regular Android or Apple tablets- THE SOUND QUALITY AND MAXIMUM VOLUME CAPABILITY IS A WEAK POINT--- Accepting the fact that these are very low cost tablets, they do offer the ability to listen to videos and music and so the built-in speakers will be relied upon by many users. In my opinion the most significant difference between these two Fire models, aside from the screen size, is the difference in sound quality. But I first want to say that neither model has the ability to provide much volume of sound, even at the very highest setting. This is a disappointment.--- The 7 Fire has a single speaker located on the rear of the device, near the bottom. It is weak and produces a very low quality sound. Also, depending on how you are holding the tablet, or if you're using a case to hold it in landscape or portrait mode, the speaker could be covered and even further muffled.--- The 8 HD Fire has better quality sound - two stereo speakers located on the side, positioned so that they will be at the top when the tablet is supported in landscape mode. It also has better sound processing ('Dolby Atmos'), and the sound quality is noticeably better than the 7. Still, the maximum volume capability is modest.--- Bottom line - if you plan to use either model for listening to music or videos, then ear pods or headphones or an external speaker is probably going to be necessary in order to get satisfactory sound. Sound quality is not going to be something owners of these small Fire tablets will be bragging about.- MY IMPRESSIONS OF BOTH MODELS AND HOW THEY COMPAREI purchased both models and illustrate them side by side in my video. They’re obviously very similar in feel and appearance, and the quality is excellent. I also like the matching Amazon cases that protect the screen when not in use and prop the tablet in either landscape or portrait orientation to make it easy to set it on a table to read or watch videos. The cases work exactly the same for both sizes.The display is the most obvious difference – not only size, but the slightly greater display content and resolution. At least that is what the Amazon specs suggest, but to my eyes they are both pretty much the same. I did find that the 7 model seemed to have a slightly brighter display, and the 'whiteness' of the display also seemed to be better.The other difference I wanted to evaluate was the sound quality, since the 7 model has only a single speaker and the 8 model has two (stereo) speakers with Dolby sound processing. For anyone using this tablet for watching videos or listening to music, I thought that would be an important difference.What I found, as also mentioned elsewhere in this review and with respect to the sound quality, was that the limited volume ability of the built-in speakers makes ear pods or headphones or the use of an external speaker almost mandatory. If those considerations are acceptable, then the higher price of the 8 model is probably well worthwhile for users who will use the table very much to listen to music or videos.For reading Kindle books or those who prefer the smaller and lighter size, the 7” model is just great (either model is fine, really).By comparison, the latest small iPad mini has a 7.0” display and is roughly between the 7” and 8” Fire tablets in size (width and height), quite a bit thinner, and about the same weight as the 7” Fire. It’s considerably more powerful and has 128 GB storage standard, but think about it – you can purchase eight 7” Fire tablets for the price of a single iPad mini today! That is really a striking difference.FURTHER THOUGHTSThese two models are the 7th generation Amazon Fire tablet – the first generation was introduced in November, 2011 as the Kindle Fire, offering the same screen size and resolution but a considerably less powerful processor, and selling for $199. Along the way they’ve offered models of various sizes and specifications, and for a short time (generations 3 and 4) their Fire models included the more sophisticated (and expensive) Fire HDX model that may have been intended to be a more direct competitor to Apple’s iPad.Then, in September 2015, Amazon introduced the $49.99 Fire 7, and since that time it seems that they’ve been happy to offer these bargain priced tablets that do everything that most people really need on a day-to-day basis. They make great Kids tablets, too, particularly the ‘Kids Edition’ models that come with the more protective case and 2-year replacement guarantee, just in case your kid drops it in the, ah, swimming pool or some such!WARRANTYThe standard warranty for both Fire models is a short 90-days. Longer warranties - 1, 2 or 3 years - are available at extra cost ($10.99, $14.99, $16.99 respectively). Compared to most devices this is a very short standard warranty.CAMERA QUALITYBoth Fire models have a 2 MP rear-facing 'HD' camera, and a 'VGA' front-facing 0.3 MP camera. These are very mediocre cameras compared to just about any smart phone or tablet currently available and anyone wanting to take photos or videos with their tablet is not going to be satisfied with the quality that can be obtained from these Fire models, but they do suffice if all you want is to take a photo to make a visual note of something for future reference.INCLUDED ACCESSORIESBoth fire models include a 5W wall charger and a VERY SHORT USB cable (just over 3 ft long).As with pretty much all Amazon Fire and Kindle models these days, you can purchase either of these tablets either with or without ‘special offers’. The $15 difference in price eliminates the ads that show when the screen is locked (but disappear when unlocked).For anyone who wants a smaller and lighter weight tablet, these Fire models have become the logical choice. The prices are now so low that they can be a casual purchase for many people, not quite disposable but something easy to pass on when the next new model comes out.I will continue to add more details here as I use these tablets more and have thoughts and comments to share." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

So in addition to the standard S/M/L rubber tips to go into your ear, it came with another set that were basically earplugs that you squish to get into your ears, and so far I like those the best. I'll update the review if I have any issues but they're great so far. Sound is very clear and pairing with my iPhone was a breeze." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I initially suspected something wrong with the fan until my wife realized the power strip was actually arcing behind the dresser. We immediately turned the breaker off and realized that if we hadn’t been home a fire could have started and caused significant damage to the house/burnt the house down. I will look into having the power strip inspected and consider legal options at this point. Extremely disappointed in Amazon and I am still shocked thinkin about what could have happened if this happened a few hours later in the day, when no one is home...It seems that this device will NOT fail safely - this is absolutely unacceptable" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

She kept bumping the cell phone up against her chin, and when I talked to her I hear numerous beeps when we are talking like someone was dialing out. She is having trouble holding the cell phone up to her head. I talked my mom in to getting an Amazon Echo as a gift from me. My sister helped to set it up since I am in another state. When you make a call with the Echo, it uses the phone number associated with the cell phone that is on your Amazon account. So I changed that to my mothers cell number. So when she makes a call, it shows up as her cell phone number on the Caller ID. Now all she has to do is say Alexa call Greg, and the Echo dials me up, and anyone in her contact list. She rests comfortably in her easy chair, and she can hear everything I say through the Echo, and I can hear everything my mother says very clearly. She can also ask Alexa to dial any number, that is very helpful as well. This feature alone was well worth the price of buying an Amazon Echo. My mother is learning very quickly all the other skills Alexa is able to do, weather, music, audiobooks, trivia questions, etc. Now that I am able to talk to my mother with ease.I would have to say this is the BEST gadget I have ever bought on Amazon.Attached is a Voice Mail from my mother, and how much she LOVES the Amazon Echo" data-balloon="See users review on this product."
