My first transaction with reloading was so easy and smooth, but this transaction and their complete lack of consistency, knowledge, awareness of the issue and what seemed like a lack of caring has turned me off to the whole thing. Horrible experienceP.S: I have received the $10 credit. But they called it a refund on two separate products and called it a Goodwill refund. Refund issued in a gift card.

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com eGift Cards" review="CAUTION!  CAUTION!  CAUTION!!!!  Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account. To protect your information, we have:-- Disabled the password to your account.-- Reversed any changes made by this party.-- Canceled any pending orders.-- Issued refunds for the charges listed below to your VISA ending in 79.It may take several days for the refunds that we issued for these charges to appear in your account.-- 100We recommend that you review all recent activity on this card and report any unauthorized charges to your financial institution.You will need to reset your password when you return to our site.

Some techniques include using malicious software to capture a user's keystrokes, trying common passwords, and sending fraudulent emails that request account information (known as phishing).To learn more about safe online shopping, visit the Security & Privacy section of our Help pages.Sincerely,Account SpecialistI immediately followed the directions and managed to re-log into the Amazon site.  I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.

She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.

I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!

I had to go online to my order on Amazon to figure out the value of each card.  I am not happy doing this.  I never mind the card recipient know the value of the card. Please go back to putting the card value on the cards or at least give me the choice of ordering with the gift card value on it or not.  some people may like this.

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com eGift Cards" review="CAUTION!  CAUTION!  CAUTION!!!!  Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account.

I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com Gift Cards - Print at Home" review="I cannot recommend that anyone purchase these.  Of course, my story is only the experience of one guy over the attempted purchase of 3 gift cards on separate occasions, but here's my Amazon gift card buying experience:I purchased one of these print-at-home gift cards for $250.  The following day I printed out the gift card and set it via US mail to the recipient.  When the recipient tried to use it, it was identified as having already been redeemed.  The recipient called Amazon and Amazon said they could not help and they would need to contact the original purchaser of the gift card (me) which they did.  I then contacted Amazon who told me the gift card had been used basically immediately upon my purchasing it (on day 1, before I'd even ever opened the PDF) by some person with a name that was completely unknown to me.  The Amazon representative informed me that the only way this could happen is if my account was compromised.  Essentially they suggested that someone hacked my account and did no other damage other than stealing a gift card code off of a PDF that I had never opened.  I find this story extremely unlikely and suggested to the Amazon representative (actually several different representatives) that this theory could be proved or disproved by an analysis of my login activity, which Amazon completely ignored.  Nevertheless I reset my password as Amazon suggested.I was told by 3 different Amazon people that my $250 refund had already been processed and I'd be seeing that soon.  Ok, Great. I thought at this point.This still left me, though, with no gift for my intended recipient.  I decided then that this must be an isolated incident so I then purchased another $250 gift card.  I sent the number to my friend immediately which he immediately redeemed without issue.OR SO I THOUGHT... I then went to look at my orders list and wouldn't you know... the most recent gift-card purchase had DISAPPEARED!  I contacted Amazon about this new issue, which I assumed was just some mix-up relating to my earlier purchase, and was told by the Amazon representative that this order had been suppressed for a reason and that I'd receive some further information about it soon.I never did.  The representative again told me my refund for the earlier gift card (which still shows up in my orders to this day, the second gift card still does not) was already processed and that I'd see it within a few business days.  Ok... fine.BUT WAIT, IT GETS SO MUCH WORSE!I then attempted to purchase a third gift card, days later... and after hour or so the purchase had not gone through.  So, I contacted Amazon yet again.  Basically the story at that time was It's your bank not giving authorization quickly enough, you just have to wait.  Again... OK, fine.  I'll wait.A few minutes later after I had ended my conversation with the Amazon representative, my Amazon account was completely disabled.  I then had to spend yet MORE time on the phone with Amazon to get my account re-instated.  The guy from the password reset team that I talked to actually seemed the most knowledgeable of anyone I'd talked to thus far, and was able to re-instate my account, but told me I was barred from purchasing any more gift cards for at least 48 hours.  He told me the security issue occurred because I purchased the gift card on my mobile device but then opened the pdf from my work computer (which I do not normally use for Amazon purchases).  This still all seems quite odd to me though, considering that when using my work computer I had to go through extra authentication to prove it was me.It seems like I have not been successful explaining any of this to Amazon in such a way that anyone understands the problem.  In short, no one from Amazon was ever able to help me, I wasted hours and hours of my time on this nonsense, and I never got the $250 back.Yes, I could contact Amazon YET AGAIN (for now the 9th time or something like that) to ask about the missing refund that I was promised several times (in writing, even), but considering that I seem to end up being punished in some way every time I do contact Amazon about this, I've just let it go and resigned myself to being out the $250.  I don't really want to lose access to my Amazon account again nor do I want to end up spending more time on the phone with them.It feels like maybe Amazon doesn't really have the appropriate infrastructure in place to be able to adequately support this product when issues do arise. Of course I'm just theorizing on cause, here.I have been an Amazon customer since they only sold books.  I have had very few issues over the years and the customer service in the past has always been great.  This was certainly not the case here.I'll never buy another gift card from Amazon." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I selected it when I bought myself a $50 Amazon gift card.  Not only did I receive it quickly, but it is just precious!  It matches the advertised picture perfectly.  It's the perfect size, colorful, and something I will definitely reuse!  It would make a cute container to hold other small items in or even work great to re-gift someone another gift card on his/her birthday.  Please see my attached photos.  The last photo shows the clear little vertical window which typically displays the back of your Amazon gift card (UPC # and Serial #).

As with other Amazon customers, I received a gift card with no balance. I scanned the gift card and entered the claim code, no funds are available. I contacted customer service and was told that the card has not been claimed to an account and that's why the balance isn't showing. Since this is a gift; I have to tell the recipient to select manage payment under their amazon account, scan or key in the claim code, then click submit to add the gift card to their amazon payment options. This is too much for a gift card. I thought that it would be simple to give this as a gift, but I didn't know that I would have to obtain and provide instructions in effort to use a gift card!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com eGift Cards" review="CAUTION!  CAUTION!  CAUTION!!!!  Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account.

Some techniques include using malicious software to capture a user's keystrokes, trying common passwords, and sending fraudulent emails that request account information (known as phishing).To learn more about safe online shopping, visit the Security & Privacy section of our Help pages.Sincerely,Account SpecialistI immediately followed the directions and managed to re-log into the Amazon site.  I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account.

I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account.

I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com eGift Cards" review="CAUTION!  CAUTION!  CAUTION!!!!  Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account.

I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.

I ordered 7 cards with 3 different amounts on them. They all came in a nice little box with cellophane around them. All the same color, all the same box and no way to tell what the amount was on any of them. I had to open the box and peel off the sticker to reveal the code in order to determine which amount was on which card. Customer service was useless.So a word to the wise. Buy a different color card if you have different amounts on the card then you will know the amount without having to rip open the packaging." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com eGift Cards" review="CAUTION!  CAUTION!  CAUTION!!!!  Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account.

I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com Gift Cards - Print at Home" review="I cannot recommend that anyone purchase these.  Of course, my story is only the experience of one guy over the attempted purchase of 3 gift cards on separate occasions, but here's my Amazon gift card buying experience:I purchased one of these print-at-home gift cards for $250.  The following day I printed out the gift card and set it via US mail to the recipient.  When the recipient tried to use it, it was identified as having already been redeemed.  The recipient called Amazon and Amazon said they could not help and they would need to contact the original purchaser of the gift card (me) which they did.  I then contacted Amazon who told me the gift card had been used basically immediately upon my purchasing it (on day 1, before I'd even ever opened the PDF) by some person with a name that was completely unknown to me.  The Amazon representative informed me that the only way this could happen is if my account was compromised.  Essentially they suggested that someone hacked my account and did no other damage other than stealing a gift card code off of a PDF that I had never opened.  I find this story extremely unlikely and suggested to the Amazon representative (actually several different representatives) that this theory could be proved or disproved by an analysis of my login activity, which Amazon completely ignored.  Nevertheless I reset my password as Amazon suggested.I was told by 3 different Amazon people that my $250 refund had already been processed and I'd be seeing that soon.  Ok, Great. I thought at this point.This still left me, though, with no gift for my intended recipient.  I decided then that this must be an isolated incident so I then purchased another $250 gift card.  I sent the number to my friend immediately which he immediately redeemed without issue.OR SO I THOUGHT... I then went to look at my orders list and wouldn't you know... the most recent gift-card purchase had DISAPPEARED!  I contacted Amazon about this new issue, which I assumed was just some mix-up relating to my earlier purchase, and was told by the Amazon representative that this order had been suppressed for a reason and that I'd receive some further information about it soon.I never did.  The representative again told me my refund for the earlier gift card (which still shows up in my orders to this day, the second gift card still does not) was already processed and that I'd see it within a few business days.  Ok... fine.BUT WAIT, IT GETS SO MUCH WORSE!I then attempted to purchase a third gift card, days later... and after hour or so the purchase had not gone through.  So, I contacted Amazon yet again.  Basically the story at that time was It's your bank not giving authorization quickly enough, you just have to wait.  Again... OK, fine.  I'll wait.A few minutes later after I had ended my conversation with the Amazon representative, my Amazon account was completely disabled.  I then had to spend yet MORE time on the phone with Amazon to get my account re-instated.  The guy from the password reset team that I talked to actually seemed the most knowledgeable of anyone I'd talked to thus far, and was able to re-instate my account, but told me I was barred from purchasing any more gift cards for at least 48 hours.  He told me the security issue occurred because I purchased the gift card on my mobile device but then opened the pdf from my work computer (which I do not normally use for Amazon purchases).  This still all seems quite odd to me though, considering that when using my work computer I had to go through extra authentication to prove it was me.It seems like I have not been successful explaining any of this to Amazon in such a way that anyone understands the problem.  In short, no one from Amazon was ever able to help me, I wasted hours and hours of my time on this nonsense, and I never got the $250 back.Yes, I could contact Amazon YET AGAIN (for now the 9th time or something like that) to ask about the missing refund that I was promised several times (in writing, even), but considering that I seem to end up being punished in some way every time I do contact Amazon about this, I've just let it go and resigned myself to being out the $250.  I don't really want to lose access to my Amazon account again nor do I want to end up spending more time on the phone with them.It feels like maybe Amazon doesn't really have the appropriate infrastructure in place to be able to adequately support this product when issues do arise. Of course I'm just theorizing on cause, here.I have been an Amazon customer since they only sold books.  I have had very few issues over the years and the customer service in the past has always been great.  This was certainly not the case here.I'll never buy another gift card from Amazon." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com Gift Cards - Print at Home" review="I cannot recommend that anyone purchase these.  Of course, my story is only the experience of one guy over the attempted purchase of 3 gift cards on separate occasions, but here's my Amazon gift card buying experience:I purchased one of these print-at-home gift cards for $250.  The following day I printed out the gift card and set it via US mail to the recipient.  When the recipient tried to use it, it was identified as having already been redeemed.  The recipient called Amazon and Amazon said they could not help and they would need to contact the original purchaser of the gift card (me) which they did.  I then contacted Amazon who told me the gift card had been used basically immediately upon my purchasing it (on day 1, before I'd even ever opened the PDF) by some person with a name that was completely unknown to me.  The Amazon representative informed me that the only way this could happen is if my account was compromised.  Essentially they suggested that someone hacked my account and did no other damage other than stealing a gift card code off of a PDF that I had never opened.  I find this story extremely unlikely and suggested to the Amazon representative (actually several different representatives) that this theory could be proved or disproved by an analysis of my login activity, which Amazon completely ignored.  Nevertheless I reset my password as Amazon suggested.I was told by 3 different Amazon people that my $250 refund had already been processed and I'd be seeing that soon.  Ok, Great. I thought at this point.This still left me, though, with no gift for my intended recipient.  I decided then that this must be an isolated incident so I then purchased another $250 gift card.  I sent the number to my friend immediately which he immediately redeemed without issue.OR SO I THOUGHT... I then went to look at my orders list and wouldn't you know... the most recent gift-card purchase had DISAPPEARED!  I contacted Amazon about this new issue, which I assumed was just some mix-up relating to my earlier purchase, and was told by the Amazon representative that this order had been suppressed for a reason and that I'd receive some further information about it soon.I never did.  The representative again told me my refund for the earlier gift card (which still shows up in my orders to this day, the second gift card still does not) was already processed and that I'd see it within a few business days.  Ok... fine.BUT WAIT, IT GETS SO MUCH WORSE!I then attempted to purchase a third gift card, days later... and after hour or so the purchase had not gone through.  So, I contacted Amazon yet again.  Basically the story at that time was It's your bank not giving authorization quickly enough, you just have to wait.  Again... OK, fine.  I'll wait.A few minutes later after I had ended my conversation with the Amazon representative, my Amazon account was completely disabled.  I then had to spend yet MORE time on the phone with Amazon to get my account re-instated.  The guy from the password reset team that I talked to actually seemed the most knowledgeable of anyone I'd talked to thus far, and was able to re-instate my account, but told me I was barred from purchasing any more gift cards for at least 48 hours.  He told me the security issue occurred because I purchased the gift card on my mobile device but then opened the pdf from my work computer (which I do not normally use for Amazon purchases).  This still all seems quite odd to me though, considering that when using my work computer I had to go through extra authentication to prove it was me.It seems like I have not been successful explaining any of this to Amazon in such a way that anyone understands the problem.  In short, no one from Amazon was ever able to help me, I wasted hours and hours of my time on this nonsense, and I never got the $250 back.Yes, I could contact Amazon YET AGAIN (for now the 9th time or something like that) to ask about the missing refund that I was promised several times (in writing, even), but considering that I seem to end up being punished in some way every time I do contact Amazon about this, I've just let it go and resigned myself to being out the $250.  I don't really want to lose access to my Amazon account again nor do I want to end up spending more time on the phone with them.It feels like maybe Amazon doesn't really have the appropriate infrastructure in place to be able to adequately support this product when issues do arise. Of course I'm just theorizing on cause, here.I have been an Amazon customer since they only sold books.  I have had very few issues over the years and the customer service in the past has always been great.  This was certainly not the case here.I'll never buy another gift card from Amazon." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.

I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!

Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account.

I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com eGift Cards" review="CAUTION!  CAUTION!  CAUTION!!!!  Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account.

I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.

They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.

Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account.

I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!

The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com Gift Cards - Print at Home" review="I cannot recommend that anyone purchase these.  Of course, my story is only the experience of one guy over the attempted purchase of 3 gift cards on separate occasions, but here's my Amazon gift card buying experience:I purchased one of these print-at-home gift cards for $250.  The following day I printed out the gift card and set it via US mail to the recipient.  When the recipient tried to use it, it was identified as having already been redeemed.  The recipient called Amazon and Amazon said they could not help and they would need to contact the original purchaser of the gift card (me) which they did.  I then contacted Amazon who told me the gift card had been used basically immediately upon my purchasing it (on day 1, before I'd even ever opened the PDF) by some person with a name that was completely unknown to me.  The Amazon representative informed me that the only way this could happen is if my account was compromised.  Essentially they suggested that someone hacked my account and did no other damage other than stealing a gift card code off of a PDF that I had never opened.  I find this story extremely unlikely and suggested to the Amazon representative (actually several different representatives) that this theory could be proved or disproved by an analysis of my login activity, which Amazon completely ignored.  Nevertheless I reset my password as Amazon suggested.I was told by 3 different Amazon people that my $250 refund had already been processed and I'd be seeing that soon.  Ok, Great. I thought at this point.This still left me, though, with no gift for my intended recipient.  I decided then that this must be an isolated incident so I then purchased another $250 gift card.  I sent the number to my friend immediately which he immediately redeemed without issue.OR SO I THOUGHT... I then went to look at my orders list and wouldn't you know... the most recent gift-card purchase had DISAPPEARED!  I contacted Amazon about this new issue, which I assumed was just some mix-up relating to my earlier purchase, and was told by the Amazon representative that this order had been suppressed for a reason and that I'd receive some further information about it soon.I never did.  The representative again told me my refund for the earlier gift card (which still shows up in my orders to this day, the second gift card still does not) was already processed and that I'd see it within a few business days.  Ok... fine.BUT WAIT, IT GETS SO MUCH WORSE!I then attempted to purchase a third gift card, days later... and after hour or so the purchase had not gone through.  So, I contacted Amazon yet again.  Basically the story at that time was It's your bank not giving authorization quickly enough, you just have to wait.  Again... OK, fine.  I'll wait.A few minutes later after I had ended my conversation with the Amazon representative, my Amazon account was completely disabled.  I then had to spend yet MORE time on the phone with Amazon to get my account re-instated.  The guy from the password reset team that I talked to actually seemed the most knowledgeable of anyone I'd talked to thus far, and was able to re-instate my account, but told me I was barred from purchasing any more gift cards for at least 48 hours.  He told me the security issue occurred because I purchased the gift card on my mobile device but then opened the pdf from my work computer (which I do not normally use for Amazon purchases).  This still all seems quite odd to me though, considering that when using my work computer I had to go through extra authentication to prove it was me.It seems like I have not been successful explaining any of this to Amazon in such a way that anyone understands the problem.  In short, no one from Amazon was ever able to help me, I wasted hours and hours of my time on this nonsense, and I never got the $250 back.Yes, I could contact Amazon YET AGAIN (for now the 9th time or something like that) to ask about the missing refund that I was promised several times (in writing, even), but considering that I seem to end up being punished in some way every time I do contact Amazon about this, I've just let it go and resigned myself to being out the $250.  I don't really want to lose access to my Amazon account again nor do I want to end up spending more time on the phone with them.It feels like maybe Amazon doesn't really have the appropriate infrastructure in place to be able to adequately support this product when issues do arise. Of course I'm just theorizing on cause, here.I have been an Amazon customer since they only sold books.  I have had very few issues over the years and the customer service in the past has always been great.  This was certainly not the case here.I'll never buy another gift card from Amazon." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com eGift Cards" review="CAUTION!  CAUTION!  CAUTION!!!!  Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account.

I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

As with other Amazon customers, I received a gift card with no balance. I scanned the gift card and entered the claim code, no funds are available. I contacted customer service and was told that the card has not been claimed to an account and that's why the balance isn't showing. Since this is a gift; I have to tell the recipient to select manage payment under their amazon account, scan or key in the claim code, then click submit to add the gift card to their amazon payment options. This is too much for a gift card. I thought that it would be simple to give this as a gift, but I didn't know that I would have to obtain and provide instructions in effort to use a gift card!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

You're not exactly proud of the circumstances that led to you consider it an acceptable use of your resources, but you have to admit that, in a pinch, it'll do the job.As far as I know, the gift card arrived at its destination, and as long as its recipient can figure out how to use a website (or enlist the help of someone who can), they can exchange it for just about anything they can imagine—and some things I'm sure they would prefer not to. All that, and I was saved the torture of coming up with a personalized gift for one more holiday. I'm calling it a win." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com eGift Cards" review="CAUTION!  CAUTION!  CAUTION!!!!  Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account.

Some techniques include using malicious software to capture a user's keystrokes, trying common passwords, and sending fraudulent emails that request account information (known as phishing).To learn more about safe online shopping, visit the Security & Privacy section of our Help pages.Sincerely,Account SpecialistI immediately followed the directions and managed to re-log into the Amazon site.  I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I sent money to my son for a one time birthday present, so he could get what he wanted.  Sounds like a good thing, right?  Well, my son doesn't have Prime, so the thing he wanted would have come considerably after his birthday, and he would have to have paid to get it sooner, but it was on Prime in My account.I went through a lengthy conversation with Amazon customer service to get the funds transferred back to my credit card.  It took me a half an hour of talking to someone who didn't understand what the heck in the world I was talking about, and after having to get snippy with the woman, her supervisor understood the dilemma and credited my account.Live and learn.  So, now, I know that I can set up Amazon Household and share my Prime with my son that way. We are in the process of setting that up, but there isn't any major birthday or holiday for a while, so we have some time to fuddle along and get that right, too.Right now, I am thinking about setting up an Amazon Allowance for myself so that I can sock money away for later in the year." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account.

I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com Gift Cards - Print at Home" review="I cannot recommend that anyone purchase these.  Of course, my story is only the experience of one guy over the attempted purchase of 3 gift cards on separate occasions, but here's my Amazon gift card buying experience:I purchased one of these print-at-home gift cards for $250.  The following day I printed out the gift card and set it via US mail to the recipient.  When the recipient tried to use it, it was identified as having already been redeemed.  The recipient called Amazon and Amazon said they could not help and they would need to contact the original purchaser of the gift card (me) which they did.  I then contacted Amazon who told me the gift card had been used basically immediately upon my purchasing it (on day 1, before I'd even ever opened the PDF) by some person with a name that was completely unknown to me.  The Amazon representative informed me that the only way this could happen is if my account was compromised.  Essentially they suggested that someone hacked my account and did no other damage other than stealing a gift card code off of a PDF that I had never opened.  I find this story extremely unlikely and suggested to the Amazon representative (actually several different representatives) that this theory could be proved or disproved by an analysis of my login activity, which Amazon completely ignored.  Nevertheless I reset my password as Amazon suggested.I was told by 3 different Amazon people that my $250 refund had already been processed and I'd be seeing that soon.  Ok, Great. I thought at this point.This still left me, though, with no gift for my intended recipient.  I decided then that this must be an isolated incident so I then purchased another $250 gift card.  I sent the number to my friend immediately which he immediately redeemed without issue.OR SO I THOUGHT... I then went to look at my orders list and wouldn't you know... the most recent gift-card purchase had DISAPPEARED!  I contacted Amazon about this new issue, which I assumed was just some mix-up relating to my earlier purchase, and was told by the Amazon representative that this order had been suppressed for a reason and that I'd receive some further information about it soon.I never did.  The representative again told me my refund for the earlier gift card (which still shows up in my orders to this day, the second gift card still does not) was already processed and that I'd see it within a few business days.  Ok... fine.BUT WAIT, IT GETS SO MUCH WORSE!I then attempted to purchase a third gift card, days later... and after hour or so the purchase had not gone through.  So, I contacted Amazon yet again.  Basically the story at that time was It's your bank not giving authorization quickly enough, you just have to wait.  Again... OK, fine.  I'll wait.A few minutes later after I had ended my conversation with the Amazon representative, my Amazon account was completely disabled.  I then had to spend yet MORE time on the phone with Amazon to get my account re-instated.  The guy from the password reset team that I talked to actually seemed the most knowledgeable of anyone I'd talked to thus far, and was able to re-instate my account, but told me I was barred from purchasing any more gift cards for at least 48 hours.  He told me the security issue occurred because I purchased the gift card on my mobile device but then opened the pdf from my work computer (which I do not normally use for Amazon purchases).  This still all seems quite odd to me though, considering that when using my work computer I had to go through extra authentication to prove it was me.It seems like I have not been successful explaining any of this to Amazon in such a way that anyone understands the problem.  In short, no one from Amazon was ever able to help me, I wasted hours and hours of my time on this nonsense, and I never got the $250 back.Yes, I could contact Amazon YET AGAIN (for now the 9th time or something like that) to ask about the missing refund that I was promised several times (in writing, even), but considering that I seem to end up being punished in some way every time I do contact Amazon about this, I've just let it go and resigned myself to being out the $250.  I don't really want to lose access to my Amazon account again nor do I want to end up spending more time on the phone with them.It feels like maybe Amazon doesn't really have the appropriate infrastructure in place to be able to adequately support this product when issues do arise. Of course I'm just theorizing on cause, here.I have been an Amazon customer since they only sold books.  I have had very few issues over the years and the customer service in the past has always been great.  This was certainly not the case here.I'll never buy another gift card from Amazon." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com eGift Cards" review="CAUTION!  CAUTION!  CAUTION!!!!  Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account. To protect your information, we have:-- Disabled the password to your account.-- Reversed any changes made by this party.-- Canceled any pending orders.-- Issued refunds for the charges listed below to your VISA ending in 79.It may take several days for the refunds that we issued for these charges to appear in your account.-- 100We recommend that you review all recent activity on this card and report any unauthorized charges to your financial institution.You will need to reset your password when you return to our site.

Some techniques include using malicious software to capture a user's keystrokes, trying common passwords, and sending fraudulent emails that request account information (known as phishing).To learn more about safe online shopping, visit the Security & Privacy section of our Help pages.Sincerely,Account SpecialistI immediately followed the directions and managed to re-log into the Amazon site.  I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Amazon.com eGift Cards" review="CAUTION!  CAUTION!  CAUTION!!!!  Read this through before you proceed to purchase a Gift Card!OK, I think that I have been more than patient with Amazon on this whole Gift Card experience.  Last week I ordered a $100.00 Gift Card for my Grandson's birthday and used the deliver by social media process.  The link was sent via Messenger to my grandson and it appeared to go through with no issues.  Just as I sent the card I remembered my other grandson's birthday was this week so I immediately went back into the Gift Card section and ordered another $100.00 Gift Card for him.  I sent it the exact same way as the first one but this one sat on the screen and kept saying processing.  I waited for a bit and noticed an email in my inbox from Amazon.  The email saidHello,We believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed your account.

I called the number for customer service (total misnomer) and after answering all their boiler plate questions and then being told that they couldn't talk to the Account Specialist I was assured that all was well and I should simply reorder the items.  I went back into the Gift Card area and again ordered two Gift Cards one for each of my grandsons.  I used the same delivery method as before and they both appeared to take.  My oldest grandson was able to redeem and use his gift card.  Yeah!  The younger one was not since each time he tried it kept telling him there was ZERO balance on the card.  My bank showed two orders of $100.00 each from Amazon.  After numerous attempts to get the card to work I again contacted Amazon and after a lengthy discussion with one of the Philippine call center folks about the issue I was told...sorry...there's nothing I can do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available.  At that point I lost most of my cool and demanded that I be put through to a higher level manager and/or transferred to a Stateside customer service rep.  After about 10 min on hold I was finally transferred and helped by an extremely nice lady.  She explained that they had to message/text the Account Specialist and she proceeded to try and help me straighten the mess out.  Unfortunately after a very long conversation and many gyrations, the problem still existed and I was told...give it 24 hours.  I  told my very disappointed grandson, that he would have to wait, he was nice about it and said don't worry, but I know he was very disappointed.  The next day I called again, since the issue was still not resolved, this time I spoke to a guy in retail and he tried very hard to help work out the situation, but again after his contacting the Account Specialist and after a very long conversation asking questions about my grandson's email, his Amazon account etc.  I finally asked if he could just call my Grandson's maternal Grandmother because he lives with her and get the information and work with her to resolve the issue.  They called her and after a lengthy process they told her WAIT 24 HRS!!!  Finally on Friday of last week I called and spoke with a very nice lady that attempted to help.  She looked at the accounts and said that we could just cancel the ones that were out and I could then attempt to put money (reload) my grandson's Amazon account gift card online in his account.  That way there would be no links etc. and he could use it right away.  Well I was on board with that!  My grandson gave me his account name and PW and I logged into his account to do what the young lady had suggested.  I followed her instructions and was able to add my credit card to his account and I then attempted to add $100.00 to his Gift card balance.  This time the gift card appeared to take, but again the processing notice came up!  My grandson got a notice in his email that his account was not locked because of apparent fraudulent activity!!!  So now here we are, his account is locked.  He didn't get his Gift Card, I have money tied up in cyberspace waiting for refunds etc.  I spoke with my bank, just on the off chance that they were somehow rejecting the purchase.  They said that they were getting request for payment with a Zero amount.  Which obviously they can't pay.  The did show three times that $100 dollars was paid to Amazon.  As of this date I have received $100 dollars back into my account and there are two other $100.00 amounts that are still in limbo.  My Order details shows that they refunded the money, but I'll believe it when I see it!  To add insult to injury my grandson's account is still lock and I have mo way of removing my Credit Card info from his account.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I definitely don't trust Amazon's system now.  I've always had great service from Amazon on the years but this event has really put a huge dent in the respect that I had!  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT." data-balloon="See users review on this product."
