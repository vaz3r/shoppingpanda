Emailed Amazon as they were still under warrenty.Bought these Anker Slim headphones as a replacement.Firstly they are lot lighter when wearing them in your ears, as the battery is not located inside each earbud.Secondly they are lot more comfortable, possibly due to the less weight on the outsideThirdly the build quality is lovely. Nice Alloy bodiesFourth the sound quality is fantastic for a budget pair of headphones.  I have an Iphone 7 and I have been contemplating buying a pair or SoundMagic E10BT's to replace my current E10's as I sometimes need to charge my Iphone and want to listen to music at the same time. I would say they are on a par with the E10's. Not equal as sometimes the bass can be a bit washy but on the whole they are spot on.I am so impressed by them I am using them on a regular basis and I think I will continue to. I originally bough them just to use for cycling but they and now being firmly placed in my bag for regular use.I have previously bought other Anker products (charger cables, usb docks and power bank) and I would recommend this brand to anyone. So much so people at my work have bough products from Anker" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="Snark SN5X Clip-On Tuner for Guitar, Bass & Violin (Current Model)" review="Maybe I got a bad one, but the 1st, E string (the high one), on both of my guitars shows up as A in this tuner, unless I put my hand on all of the remaining 5 strings; and, then, it usually shows an E, but not right away. This quirk just doesn't give me a warm fuzzy so I've reverted using the built-in tuner on my acoustic. (Honestly, this is not a step up from my old SN-1, which still works fine, though it lost one of the rubber pads.)Update (05 Aug 2016): I had contacted Snark support about the problem I was seeing and they said it was not normal, and sent me a new tuner. This one seems fine, but it is also clear (and confirmed by Snark) that they have changed this model slightly. The older one that I got says SuperTight on the face and has a metallic brass/gold power button and bars for LEDs in the note display. The newer one simply says Snark on the face (both say SuperTight on the back), has a yellow power button, and small square LEDs to comprise the note's letter.Picture of the two models attached while displaying the odd, occasional confusion about the high-E tuning. (The older display is really just as clear as the new one, but the angle I turned the guitar/camera to cut out reflected overhead light makes it seem grayed out a bit.)Update 2 (21 Aug 2016): I've had a chance to use the newer version tuner in noisy situations and it definitely behaves better than the older model I was originally shipped. I didn't A/B it with my old, blue Snark, but it behaves well enough that I can say it seems to be Ok for my purposes. It does not seem like an improvement, though, so just moving the review from 3 to 4 stars." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

                <div class="review-button" onclick="reviewButton_onClick(this);" title="On Stage XCG4 Black Tripod Guitar Stand, Single Stand" review="I have a couple of FretRest guitar stands I bought from Guitar Center (HT1010). They're $8 more so I figured these were probably the same thing, probably from the same factory in China, just with a different label. Save $8 why not right? Nope. They probably used about one-third less material so that's where some of that $8 savings came from.I immediately noticed how much shorter the back/middle leg was compared to the FretRest stand. But then I thought, maybe the FR is just unnecessarily long and this short one might work fine. I put my guitar on it, and pushed it (while holding it) and compared the two, and this one definitely doesn't put up much resistance at all. With a little push the thing will fall right back. The FretRest will actually hold it even with 2-3 times the pressure. That's the biggest problem.But everywhere else you look, the rubber feet, way smaller, the rubber latch, smaller, even the metal tubing is about one-third smaller.I have some fairly nice guitars, but even if I just had a basic guitar I probably wouldn't try to save the $8 and put it on this stand. It might be fine, but I'd rather spend an extra $8 and get a stronger stand.Take a look at the attached photos. The On Stage one is on the left. The FretRest from Guitar Center is on the right in all the pictures. And no, I don't work for Guitar Center or even particularly like them, but the stand from them is better than this one." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It is the first stand that I have every bought. So I can't compare it to other mic stands. So far from the use I put into it. It works great. I was surprised when I put it in the position I wanted it and it didn't recoil back. Again this is my first stand so was expecting some recoil back. It holds my blue yeti mic and it has no problem whats so every  even though it mentions not suitable for blue yeti.Keep in that in mind when purchasing . Ive seen comments about some coming with mic adapters and some comments saying that they don't. Mind didn't come with one but still giving it 5 stars since I didn't read anywhere on the description that it came with it. The material is steel and feels good, It makes my desk look good it looks good with my yeti.i have very happy with this purchase." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Been playing for about a year fingerstyle acoustic and these sound the best by far. They offer a bright almost whiny tone, very loud and vibrant, easy to hammer on/pull off. Subtle movements on the fret board can be heard that many other strings can't replicate. Up until now my favorite have been D'Addario coated philosopher bronze which are amazing also, but the sound with the elixer is unmatched. My only criticism is one of the strings coating appeared to be separating after only a few days of play. Only on one string, I feel it may have been a random defect. Easy 4 star, 5 if not the coating issue." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

But the metal used is thin and flexible.  I set up the stand and press down with my hands and the stand is rubbery and flexes easily.  With a heavy keyboard (Yamaha Motif) it is just too flexible and bouncy for stage use which makes it useless for me.  The plastic locking handle (to set the height) looks and feels like it will break - probably fine for home but won't hold up for a working musician.If you're just putting a plastic Casio or similar home type keyboard it is fine for that." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

All 15 of my guitars are hanging on the walls and in the 15 years I've been using String Swings I've never had a problem with them. They hold every guitar, regardless of neck shape or style. Since they swivel, my Fender necks are just as secure as my Gibson necks. The depth is adjustable, so they will account for the difference between acoustic guitars and solid body electrics. While I never had a problem with the rubber grip on the hangers marring the finish of my Nitro coated guitars, I didn't want to take a chance, so I use self-adhesive sheets of felt and wrap the posts with felt to further protect the guitar's finish. I try and screw them into studs to support the weight, and where I can't do it, I hang some of my lighter guitars, but the anchors that come with the hangers are strong and secure... although I sprung a couple bucks and bought similar screw-in anchors; but made out of metal - just that added bit of security to make sure nothing happens. I also strongly recommend (as others have done) that you run a humidifier in the room housing your guitars (40-50% humidity is perfect). I recommend the Honeywell Honeywell HCM-6009 QuietCare 9-Gallon Output Console Humidifier with Air Washing Technology" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I love to sing, I love karaoke, I love pink, and I love shiny things so this was a no brainer for me.When I got it I was happy to see it was well packaged in a hard shell case. It came with an aux type cord and a charging cord, two little windscreens, and I even threw in a kissy face emoji keychain. Also enclosed was a little manual and a warranty card.I synced it right away using my iPads Bluetooth and off I went! It has pretty good sound and you can control the music volume, the track, the mic volume, and how much echo your vocals will have from the mic.I have spent hours singing with this and plan to use it much more in the future. Even though it’s not a professional mic I have gotten a lot of quality vocal practicing in and I am super pleased.I am thinking of getting another one for a friend that is into karaoke too.I have attached a video review as well.I hope this review is helpful!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

The non-removable boom will not support any standard mic: I put my Shure SM58 on, tightened the boom as much as possible, and at a 45 degree angle it just droops on down - completely useless for stage. At this price, I'd remove the garbage boom and use a gooseneck instead - but the boom is permanently clamped, instead of threaded, to the main stand shaft.Delivered this morning, returning this afternoon." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have never had a microphone pick up my voice correctly. When I speak low, it fades out, when I go high, it cuts out. This microphone quite contrary catches everything I say without picking up weird background humming! I'm not like, some bonafide super special feller who knows that of which he speaks of when it comes to mic quality, but I find this instrument one of the best I've messed around with while dabbling. It's heavy! The ball core is like lifting a puppy. The stand that comes attached needs the screw at the bottom tightened to keep the legs mostly stable.I have chosen to completely ignore all the other reviews explaining safety and secure desk holds, and I just stick the dang thing anywhere. On a table, on my keyboard, shoved it in amongst a pile of pillows. Look, I'm not that professional when people aren't looking and my desk is literally my bed. He doesn't fall over, and he picks up my noises no matter where I put him. (Oh no I've gendered it. Next comes naming it, and that's when you know you love things too much.) I've been singing karaoke like crazy, and my poor long-range boyfriend who has hearing issues can finally hear my real voice, clearly and properly.I bought a pop filter, it hasn't arrived yet, but I'll probably need it, but for now, the pop pop pop isn't unreasonable.The red light on the front is obnoxiously bright, I just put a little tape over it. Simple. You need a quiet room for using this, but not too much of one. My heater going off doesn't register for instance, neither does my computer. I'm gonna crunch some fresh snow from outside so you can hear how crisp it is though, with a metric you can actually copy, probably. [I end up getting snow everywhere, on my keyboard, and my mouse, so I'm moving and dropping them here.]I love it, it was well worth the money (I paid $30 or so thanks to repackaging and used, but worth the $50 or so.) and I can already tell this little cutie (and it is cute, my aging mother saw it and started giggling and wanted to hold it) is going to be a fine part of my vocal life." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It is Distributed by Yamaha Corporation of America• The product is imported by The Music People Inc of Berlin, CTPositives:• Easy to assembleYou learn to manage the wobble, and the bench does work.  However, it is never as stable as you wish.As for the bait and switch......it is as if Rolex would distribute a cheap watch they don't make because they have a good distribution network, and the shops advertising the cheap watch online tell you it is a Rolex when it is not." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I recently bought a used guitar which was strung with something else - couldn't wait to get the EB strings on there. Nothing else has the feel and sound - they just have a musicality and aliveness to them and manufacturing quality has been consistent over the years. I'd recommend these for any guitar, any style - harmonics, sustain, feel - they have it all. Only decision is .010's or .009's - I like to use .010's when tuned down to E flat, and .009's for standard tuning. If you don't like your guitar and it's strung with other strings, try these." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

For £20 it has very good features. The sound quality sounds better than my iPhone earphones as they are noise cancelling ( great feature). Connects very easily with my iPhone. Highly confort level as you get many earbuds to find the right size for your ear. I mainly use these during gym and travels as it allows me to easily move my phone around without being held back my wires. The range is very good as I leave my phone to charge and can walk around while still connected. The only downside if I'm being very picky is the battery life ( only last 3hours it pure music) and a smaller “control bar”. Other than hag great product." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

As seen in the photo this is possible. Yea! The photo uses back illumination so you see the support areas behind the music. The page clips work very nice.  I like the fact that it's matte black and not chrome which is distracting to (and from) the performer. The base and extension pole proves sturdy enough to place sheet music one at a time. I put a 40 page practice book on it as well with no problem, but you will not be placing a 1 inch thick 'fake book' of music on this stand. Don't expect too much from a portable. The shelf that the music sits on is about 3/4 inch deep. The top of the page as shown is 4' 2 from the floor; which is about as high as I feel comfortable with. In the nylon zippered carry case it weighs just 1000 grams (2 lbs) - about the weight of a can of spaghetti sauce. At a great price I bought 2 and am happy." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

This is a nice little ukulele --it's the Kala KA-15S Mahogany Soprano-- and I like the concept of starter kit; it addresses the things -- tuning and a few initial chords -- a new player needs most. I would prefer a clip-on tuner like a Snark or Hola to the app tuner, though. While this would add a little to the price, I think the clip-ons are easier for new players to work with than the app, which is a bit imprecise. The online lessons are straighforward and useful." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I have been playing piano/keys for over 20 years - mostly in church - and whenever I do a gig, I travel with a sustain pedal just in case. I've learned the hard way why a pedal is so important. Even when I was in India for 10 months, I had to have my own sustain pedal just in case. The little dinky ones that usually come with keyboards are a joke and don't work consistently.I always tend to spring for the universal sustain pedals that have the polarity switch on the bottom so they can be used with all keyboards. I personally use my pedal with my Casio Privia PX-300 but at church, I use the pedal with the Yamaha MO-8. I've also used the pedal with a Korg and Alesis (forget which models).I'm a huge fan of the classic-style sustain pedal since I learned on an upright piano. The slip-resistant rubber bottom doesn't work well on carpet (in my opinion) - I tend to play more standing up and I constantly have to readjust the pedal mid-performance but I'm sure it would stay in place better when not on carpet.The pedal definitely works like an acoustic piano's sustain pedal since it has half-pedal expressive capabilities, which can be extremely useful.The 6-foot cable has a 1/4-inch jack to plug into your keyboard.I tend to leave the plastic covering on the pedal to protect it and everything works fine.I highly recommend this pedal." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It comes coiled with two attached velcro ties.  On dissection (see attached image), it can be seen that the solder joints are covered by insulators (although not shrink-wrapped) and the shielding is made of braided copper.  Only time will tell if it can endure heavy usage. For me, this is a back-up cable, as I normally connect my mics wirelessly.  If you want greater insurance against premature failure, you should probably buy up-market or at least keep a spare." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

After watching and reading a handful of reviews, I decided to spend a little extra (not the cheapest entry level mic on the market) and I'm glad I did. the sound quality out of this little thing is impressive.

I have so many guitars now, I wanted a new one, so I purchased the same thing in January 2017.  What a disappointment!  The thing is not at all like the old one.  I could tell the minute I took it out of the package.  The plastic is cheaper, lighter material, and the clipper end/hinge is made of thin tin now.  The hinge is not as smooth.  The one from just three years ago from Planet Waves was heavier duty all the way around.Planet Waves has cheapened their overseas supplier to make a buck.  I will not be buying another of these string winders, and am reluctant to buy further Planet Waves/D'Addario products from here on out." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

As others have said, this is an accurate tuner, and the display is much better than other tuners. I have used the Snark, which is less expensive, but I recommend the UberTuner over the Snark for these reasons:1. The UberTuner is built better than the Snark. It has a bigger and brighter display and the clamp is stronger. It just feels more substantial. The arm from the clamp to the tuner is stronger and looks like it will last.2. When the instrument is in tune, the LED indicator on the Snark will hover in the middle but bounce around a little. This is fine, except when compared to the UberTuner which has an LED circle that lights up around the note you are tuned to. This light stays on and doesn't bounce on and off like the indicator on the Snark.3. To test each tuner, I clamped the Snark and UberTuner on my guitar at the same time. Both are accurate, but the UberTuner is slightly more responsive. Like I said above, it is easier to tell when the instrument is in tune with the UberTuner since it has the LED circle that lights up.My only suggestion for the UberTuner is to mark the On/Off button a little more clearly. It is a black button on the side of the black case, next to two other buttons. It would be nice if the On/Off button was either a different color, was raised a little, or had a little nub you could feel with your finger. This would make it a little easier to find and turn the unit on and off without looking so hard for the button. This change would also make it harder to confuse the On/Off button with the other two buttons on the side of the case. The On/Off button on the Snark is a different color and is located on the face of the unit.Final recommendation: Spend the extra few bucks and get this tuner. It's well worth it!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Its pretty sturdy and doesn't dip or sink. I set it where I want it and it stays. The clamp used to grab the table is also pretty great and seems heavy duty compared to another clamp arm I have for a drafting table light.I'm actually thinking of ordering another one of these arms for a webcam, but am making sure the mount will work with a camera I want. Will update." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

The headset could easily connect to my phone and therefore I started playing music. The earpiece was so clear in playing music being small. However I couldn't make calls, I couldn't hear the recipient nor could the recipient hear me. Now at this point I was very disappointed and contacted AngLink the Seller. They replied back within a couple of hours stating that they have sent another out and it should come within the next couple of days. This is the reason why I am commenting 5 star due to the quick customer service that they provided me. It is a MUST BUY if your looking for a Bluetooth headset. Even though mine went faulty doesn't mean all of them are. If you look at the other comments, you will see that the product is truly amazing. It is a really good product with good instructions on how to use the product.Since being refunded through the best customer support I decided to buy it again, and since receiving the product, I tried to see if calling was still an issue. But no, this headset was like a dream. The first one must have been a bluff but hey. Like I said, definitely a must buy" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

If you have music on you won't be able to hear it, but if you're in a silent room using the lights as a means to relax, you can definitely hear the motor going.- The circular motion is off center: this is more of a personal preference where I want the rotation of the lights to be completely centered, not moving at an oblong shape, but it is a little distracting.- The DMX button seems to have no actual function? If you press it nothing happens.- While it does react to music, the music has to either be VERY loud or within 2-3 inches of the projectorOverall, the projector is a very nice entry as a party scene decoration with minimal cost and lots of different modes, but don't expect your music and the light show to sync up completely and you do have to have your music very loud or VERY close to the projector for it to hear it." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Even Monster cables feel cheap after handling this one. No matter how hard I try I cannot get the cable inside to kink within the covering.The cord gets a little stiff in the cold, but softens up quickly when brought into the warm.The stress reliefs stay in place and help to keep the jack connector covers in it place.Plus, should you ever have a cable malfunction, just take it to the nearest music store and trade it for a new one...for free. That’s right. No fuss, no waiting, and no receipts. If a cord goes bad, Fender has your back.Great instrument cables. Would highly recommend." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

I normally play this song sitting down and the intro had a finger picking part and transitions to a full on strum in the chorus, so by sitting down, I had time to pick up my pick from my desk and start strumming.  When I stood up there, I fidgeted about, trying to figure out what to do with my pick and I half-joked on the mic to the crowd about how I sit down playing this song.  Thankfully, one of the audience members brought up a chair for me to sit on.  Ha ha!Anyway, bought this strap so I wouldn't have to deal with that ever again, and the transition from fingers to pick worked fine and now I'm ready for almost anything." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

The worst parts of the acoustic were terrible tuners and equally awful strings.  I quickly ordered up these D'Addario strings and restrung it, and the difference was night and day.They did require a lot of stretching before they would stay in tune, but now they hold tune excellently and seem like they will last quite a long time.  Happy with my purchase, I'd definitely recommend these.Please rate up if I was able to help you out :)- Matt" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

This quirk just doesn't give me a warm fuzzy so I've reverted using the built-in tuner on my acoustic. (Honestly, this is not a step up from my old SN-1, which still works fine, though it lost one of the rubber pads.)Update (05 Aug 2016): I had contacted Snark support about the problem I was seeing and they said it was not normal, and sent me a new tuner. This one seems fine, but it is also clear (and confirmed by Snark) that they have changed this model slightly. The older one that I got says SuperTight on the face and has a metallic brass/gold power button and bars for LEDs in the note display. The newer one simply says Snark on the face (both say SuperTight on the back), has a yellow power button, and small square LEDs to comprise the note's letter.Picture of the two models attached while displaying the odd, occasional confusion about the high-E tuning. (The older display is really just as clear as the new one, but the angle I turned the guitar/camera to cut out reflected overhead light makes it seem grayed out a bit.)Update 2 (21 Aug 2016): I've had a chance to use the newer version tuner in noisy situations and it definitely behaves better than the older model I was originally shipped. I didn't A/B it with my old, blue Snark, but it behaves well enough that I can say it seems to be Ok for my purposes. It does not seem like an improvement, though, so just moving the review from 3 to 4 stars." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

It comes coiled with two attached velcro ties.  On dissection (see attached image), it can be seen that the solder joints are covered by insulators (although not shrink-wrapped) and the shielding is made of braided copper.  Only time will tell if it can endure heavy usage. For me, this is a back-up cable, as I normally connect my mics wirelessly.  If you want greater insurance against premature failure, you should probably buy up-market or at least keep a spare." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Even my wife and I fight over playing time now. Great price also after having done all the research. Best part of all- it comes with headphones so my son can practice all he wants, as loud as he wants without annoying the rest of us! Definitely recommend!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

They are simple to install and even come with the sheetrock screws you need to hang them on walls. I can't rember what drill bit I used, I just matched it to the plastic insert. It would have made it a bit easier if the size of the drill bit was listed somewhere in the product description or on a sheet included with the product. Anyway, the product is perfect for what we needed. I will be ordering another one for myself (I am sharing one with my daughter's ukulele) and another for a friend!" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

At about the 80 foot mark it started cutting out every once in a while. I am actually really impressed with this range. The range test I did was going through walls and outside. I have used other mic sets that had to use much bigger antennas to get similar range.Voice quality - I uploaded a video so you can hear the voice quality. I think it is really quite good.Build quality - The mic and receiver are plastic but overall it is sturdy and durable.Overall I am quite impressed with this mic. Both the range and the voice quality ended up being better than I thought it would be for the price. This is definitely a great unit to have if you just need to set something up super quick and you already have a amp or mixer." data-balloon="See users review on this product."

Has 150 lights and many colors to choose from , with the remote that it comes with you can change the mode to a lot of different choices and colors and turn on and off also. You can also cut them on the cut lines to make it fit where you will be using them and will not effect the lights at all" data-balloon="See users review on this product."

They are all I use. I've tried many strings over the few years I have been playing, and I have decided that these are the best for me. Be weary however, as the last 2 times I have received a 3 pack of these, they have been counterfeit. All 3 packs of strings had the same players circle number on them. I emailed D'Addario and they told me they came back as counterfeit. So I returned that 3 pack and Amazon sent me another 3 pack, and these ones are fakes as well. I didn't even know people faked guitar strings. If you get a pack with no crimp on the bottom of the plastic packaging, then they are fake. Or if you get a 3 pack and all the numbers are the same, then they are fake. You can also just go to D'Addarios website and they have a page where you can enter the numbers and letters on the packaging and they will tell you if the strings are real. Hoping that eventually they get real ones back in stock and then Ill buy again, but I'm gonna wait a month or so" data-balloon="See users review on this product."
